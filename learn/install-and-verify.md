**THE BUILD STUDIO · ADVANCED KIT**

# Install and verify your kit

Install through the Claude desktop interface below, or use the [terminal route](#install-from-a-terminal). Then open your own project in Claude Code and check that your kit commands are available.

## Install in Claude desktop

Install and sign in to the [Claude desktop app](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop-quickstart). You do not need a separate CLI installation for this route. The screenshots use **Customize**, which adds plugins to your Claude account. Use the same Claude account when opening Code. See Anthropic's [account plugin and sync instructions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13837440-use-plugins-in-claude) for account and organization requirements.

The screenshots show the Starter marketplace. For Advanced, enter the **Advanced repository below** and select the `dlag-advanced-` plugins. The navigation is the same; the images are left unchanged.

**Private repository:** Your GitHub account must have access to Advanced. If Claude asks you to connect GitHub, use the account with access. If the repository does not appear, confirm access before retrying. Advanced does not require Starter.

### 1. Open Customize

In Claude desktop, select **Customize** in the left sidebar.

![Open Customize in the Claude desktop sidebar](../assets/screenshots/desktop/01-open-customize.jpeg)

### 2. Open Plugins and add a marketplace

Select the **Plugins** tab. Open **+ Add** at the upper right, then choose **Add marketplace**.

![Select Plugins, then Add and Add marketplace](../assets/screenshots/desktop/02-add-marketplace.jpeg)

### 3. Choose Add from a repository

Select **Add from a repository** in the dialog.

![Choose Add from a repository](../assets/screenshots/desktop/03-add-from-repository.jpeg)

### 4. Select this kit's repository

Paste this GitHub repository name into the repository field, then select the matching result:

```text
legioncodeinc/develop-like-a-girl-advanced-resources
```

The image below shows the Starter search. Use `develop-like-a-girl-advanced-resources` for this kit.

![Starter example: find and select the repository](../assets/screenshots/desktop/04-select-repository.jpeg)

### 5. Sync the marketplace

Confirm the selected repository, review the notice, and select **Sync**. This makes the marketplace's plugins available to add.

![Starter example: sync the selected marketplace](../assets/screenshots/desktop/05-sync-marketplace.jpeg)

### 6. Add Core, then your builder

Add **Dlag advanced core** first. Then add **Dlag advanced website builder**, **Dlag advanced app builder**, or both. Display capitalization may vary; the exact plugin IDs are listed below.

| Plugin | Exact ID | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core | `dlag-advanced-core` | Shared planning, design, implementation foundations, and reviews. |
| Website Builder | `dlag-advanced-website-builder` | Public pages, content, and inquiry forms. |
| App Builder | `dlag-advanced-app-builder` | Signed-in workflows, data screens, search, and integrations. |

![Starter example: Add buttons for Core, App Builder, and Website Builder](../assets/screenshots/desktop/06-add-plugins.jpeg)

The screenshot shows the plugins available with **Add** buttons. Select Add for each plugin you want, and confirm it appears under **Yours**. Syncing the marketplace alone does not add all three plugins.

## Open your project and verify

Open the **Code** view in Claude desktop, choose a **Local** environment, and select **your own project folder**. Start a new session signed into the same Claude account. In the prompt box, type `/` and look for this kit's commands. For example:

```text
/dlag-advanced-core:get-started Inspect this folder and propose a first task.
Keep the proposal in chat.
```

A useful response describes the folder and recommends a next task. This command prepares a setup proposal; application implementation follows separately. The kit commands go in the Code prompt box. Commands beginning with `claude plugin` belong in a terminal.

Account-installed plugins sync into supported Claude Code versions. If a command is missing, check **Customize → Plugins → Yours**, confirm the same account, and start a fresh Code session. Organization policy or disabled sync can affect availability. See the [official sync guidance](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13837440-use-plugins-in-claude) and [desktop command guidance](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop#use-skills).

You do not need to clone this marketplace or work inside its `plugins/` directory. Your app or website belongs in its own folder.

## Install from a terminal

Use this alternative if you prefer the CLI. You do not need to repeat it after a successful desktop account installation and command check.

Have Claude Code CLI and Git available. Follow the [CLI setup guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) if needed, then check:

```bash
claude --version
git --version
```

Add the marketplace and install Core:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/legioncodeinc/develop-like-a-girl-advanced-resources.git
claude plugin install dlag-advanced-core@dlag-advanced
```

Install the builder you need, or both:

```bash
claude plugin install dlag-advanced-website-builder@dlag-advanced
claude plugin install dlag-advanced-app-builder@dlag-advanced
```

For this private repository, Git must already be authenticated with an account that has access. These commands install at user scope by default. Local desktop Code sessions on the same computer share those settings. CLI installations remain local to the machine; they do not add plugins to your Claude account. [Installation scopes and account sync](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins).

Open a terminal in your project folder and run `claude`, or open that folder in desktop Code. In the terminal CLI session, `/plugin` shows installed plugins. On desktop, type `/` in the Code prompt to check the available kit commands.

## If installation stops

Check the exact repository name, account access, and any organization restrictions. An **Add** button means the plugin still needs to be added. If it is added but missing from Code, check account sync and session availability before reinstalling. Do not paste credentials into a prompt or issue. [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) has the next checks.

**Next:** [Your first session](your-first-session.md).
