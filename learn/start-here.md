**THE BUILD STUDIO · ADVANCED KIT**

# Start here

Your first goal is a clear, useful task. You do not need to understand the whole technology stack before you begin.

## Choose a result

Write one sentence: **“I want [person] to be able to [action] so that [result].”** A good first website result might be a visitor understanding a service and sending an inquiry. A good first app result might be a signed-in member saving and reopening a private note.

Keep the first version small enough to describe in a few sentences. Put nice-to-have ideas in a separate list. The [project brief worksheet](worksheets/project-brief.md) helps you capture both without turning every idea into a requirement.

## Know what you are installing

Core contains the shared planning, design, implementation foundations, and review methods. Website Builder adds public-page and content workflows. App Builder adds signed-in workflows and product features. Each builder needs this kit's Core.

A Playbook is the method and its supporting material. A Specialist applies a method within a focused responsibility. The Build Lead helps choose the right work and owner. These names describe how the studio is organized; actual tool access and delegation depend on your Claude Code session.

Advanced uses SvelteKit on Vercel with Neon and WorkOS. Its website workflow includes a separate Payload CMS for editors. You can install Advanced directly without Starter.

## Prepare only what you need now

Have the Claude desktop app or Claude Code CLI available, choose your project folder, and bring your idea or existing files. Git is needed for the terminal marketplace route. Add approved logos, colors, and copy when they matter to the task. You can plan before creating hosting accounts or connecting payment services.

Follow the [desktop screenshot walkthrough or terminal instructions](install-and-verify.md), then open your project in desktop Code or the CLI and send:

```text
/dlag-advanced-core:get-started My goal is to help a visitor understand my service and
request a conversation. Inspect the current folder and propose one useful first task.
Explain any missing decisions in plain language.
```

## Recognize a useful answer

The response should say what already exists, what the first task would change, and how you will know it works. Unknowns should be called out. If the response jumps straight to a large application, ask it to return to one person, one action, and one observable result.

**Next:** [Your first session](your-first-session.md).
