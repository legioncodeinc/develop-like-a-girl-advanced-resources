# Command reference

These are the **14 public commands** shipped with the Advanced Kit. Enter them in the desktop **Code** prompt box or an interactive Claude Code CLI session, not at a shell prompt. On desktop, type `/` to browse available commands. Arguments after the command are your plain-language request. Use the full prefix so the correct kit and plugin are selected.

## Commands, Playbooks, and tools

A public command selects a workflow. Some bundled Playbooks, such as identity or payments, have no dedicated public command; request them through plain language or ask Build Lead for the appropriate handoff. Read-only reviewers and coordinators do not acquire implementation or shell permissions merely because a command is available.

For copyable requests, open [Prompts](../prompts.md). For terminal installation commands, open [Install and verify](../install-and-verify.md).
