# Platform, proxy, upload and deployment checks

## P1. Deployment identity

Read actual SvelteKit hooks/routes, Vite/Vercel adapter configuration, environment access and deployment modules. Inspect the separate Payload/Next CMS deployment independently. A config file is only a hint when actual deployment is unknown. Source control cannot prove live settings. Do not introduce another backend; describe uncertainty.

## P2. Trusted canonical origin and forwarding

A client can control Host/Forwarded/X-Forwarded-* unless the actual ingress overwrites and restricts them. Read where those values influence CSRF, redirects, fetch URLs, IP allowlists, rate limits or logs. Do not select the left-most forwarded-for value as a universal identity. Vercel ingress metadata has a defined trust boundary; require project evidence before trusting it. Admin authorization must use verified actor/capability rather than IP alone. A documented trusted proxy that removes attacker headers can rule out the specific spoofing path, but needs actual config evidence.

## P3. Remote resource and image fetch

For any Worker preview/image proxy, spell out scheme, host, port, path, query and redirect policy. Broad shared-host wildcards, arbitrary URLs or private addresses can widen SSRF/cost surface. A project-specific origin/path is narrower but still needs DNS and redirect considerations. No built-in image optimizer or its advisories is assumed. R2 binding access avoids arbitrary outbound URL construction where a stored owned object identifier is sufficient.

## P4. Untrusted SVG and files

Uploaded SVG/HTML can contain active content. Establish actual content type, disposition, delivery origin, CSP/sandbox and ownership. Serving arbitrary active uploads inline on the application origin creates a separate risk from static trusted icons. Attachment disposition and a restrictive policy help, but are not proof of malware removal or safe rendering in all contexts. Do not introduce a new processing provider. Bound request/file sizes and counts, and derive object keys/authorization on the server rather than trusting caller paths.

## P5. Redirects and rewrites

Trace destination hostname or whole URL constructed from path/query/form/captured values. Same-site relative redirect guards must reject //, backslashes, controls and parser normalization surprises. Use configured canonical origins, never unchecked Host as a basis for OAuth/payment return decisions. A regex restricting a tenant label still needs controlled suffix/lookup and ownership. A narrower internal navigation target is lower impact; appending tokens to an attacker target is materially worse. Existing local Security snippets contain a concrete validated redirect helper.

## P6. Security response controls

Inspect app and platform layers before calling a header absent. Configuration precedence, errors and static routes can differ. HSTS scope/preload needs full domain readiness. Framing, nosniff, referrer and permissions controls fit purpose; version banners are context, not automatic exploit evidence. Public evidence can be reviewed with the local passive methods, but this source review does not authorize fetching a deployed site.

## P7. Build safety and dev exposure

Look for skipped type/lint/validation checks and any deployed development server, exposed dev origin or debug endpoint. These are contextual priorities; disabled checks alone are not a confirmed access-control flaw. Inspect the actual deployed artifact/process evidence before asserting production exposure. Vite mode and NODE_ENV are different concepts; another framework's compiler-gated security behavior cannot be asserted for the installed SvelteKit or Payload/Next runtime without evidence. No build runs merely to inspect the method.

## P8. Bindings and platform secrets

Cloudflare bindings/secrets belong in server context, never root loader env spreads or browser VITE_ values. R2, Resend and Stripe secrets are server-held; no newsletter/job provider is selected. Return named public config fields only. The existence of a binding type does not prove permission or live secret configuration. Do not read private values or configure providers during review.

## P9. Static output and runtime caching

Classify each prerender/static route as public data. Sensitive/user-specific views and loader responses must retain request-time authorization. Check service-worker explicit cache policies and application-managed cache separately from HTTP headers. Clearing browser state on logout does not necessarily delete cached responses or cross-request memory. Use public-asset allowlists, no-store and actual exclusion code. Runtime/cache tests remain a separate authorized evidence category.

## P10. Unsupported flags and packages

An option/API from another framework is not an equivalent security control in this stack. Identify dead/no-op copied configuration and the actual missing check. Do not install an unsupported runtime or simply rename APIs. Where a feature has no selected implementation, record that exact gap and keep the generic boundary requirement. No provider console, callback registration or app store/release action follows from reading this method.
