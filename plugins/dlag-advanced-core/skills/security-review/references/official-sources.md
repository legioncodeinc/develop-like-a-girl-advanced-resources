# Primary security references

The local guides carry the procedures; no separate repository or source archive is required to use this Playbook. External links support verification of technical facts. The Security Specialist cannot browse with its read-only tools: use supplied current versioned documentation or ask the appropriately authorized caller for the exact missing evidence. Documentation access does not authorize API calls, installations or settings changes.

The inherited React Router/Supabase/Workers references below are historical comparison sources from the original Core. They do not select Advanced providers or establish current advisory status. On 2026-10-21 the adaptation opened the official SvelteKit server-only-module and load pages, Payload Local API overview and Drizzle update page to check the named boundary/API examples. This was a targeted documentation check, not an advisory sweep or runtime test. All other source URLs remain qualification pointers; match the receiving project's actual installed version.

| Risk qualification | [OWASP ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) | Load exact version/requirement text before asserting compliance |

A fact about a product/version/plan must come from the actual relevant documentation and target evidence. Do not treat an overview as the text of every ASVS requirement, old incident statistics as a target verdict, or a source URL as proof that the code implements its controls. A selected telemetry, third-party intake or database library needs its own installed API/current primary contract before a vendor-specific conclusion.
