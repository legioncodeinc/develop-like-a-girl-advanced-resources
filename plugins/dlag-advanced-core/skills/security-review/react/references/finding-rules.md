# Finding rules: severity, confidence, and output files

> Advanced scope: this React catalog applies only to the separate Payload CMS. Other frameworks are conditional comparisons; no React/JSX helper inspects Svelte. Advisory versions remain historical candidates until current supplied primary evidence confirms them.

> Scope: read supplied local evidence with Read/Grep/Glob/Skill and return guidance in chat. The Python helpers, commands, writes, builds, probes and tests below are optional source for a separately authorized caller. If helper output is unavailable, trace the listed checks manually and mark the execution gap. No installation, credential access, provider operation or new assistant/stack is authorized.

> Version qualification: numeric advisory/version/maintenance data is a dated 2026-09-30 offline snapshot, not a current vulnerability database or a safe-version recommendation. Confirm actual installed features, deployment and current primary advisories before promoting a snapshot candidate. Framework SSR does not imply RSC; no RSC runtime, alternate router, MDX engine, sanitizer or telemetry dependency is selected here.

Load when: writing any finding, `metrics-build-studio-react-review.json`, or notes (guide 05). The local [Security Review report](../../references/audit-output-format.md) and [severity rubric](../../references/severity-rubric.md) govern this method. The fields and examples below are self-contained.

## Output files (per-source, because several security reviewers share `02-security/`)

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `review-output/react/findings.jsonl` | one finding per line, the field definitions below |
| `review-output/react/metrics.json` | the measures below, `dimension: "security"` |
| `review-output/react/notes.md` | scope, stack map, "Not confirmed" list, handoffs, caps |
| `review-output/react/raw/` | `version-findings.jsonl`, `version-summary.json`, `sink-candidates.json`, command logs |

The Specialist returns these records in chat. A separately authorized caller may save them at accepted fresh local destinations and reconcile duplicate roots; no merge engine is bundled or required.

## Ids

`SEC-REACT-NNN`, three digits, starting at 001, unique in this file. Run the version script with `--start-id 1` first; continue numbering from the next free number for manual findings.

## Confidence

| Value | Use when | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `confirmed` | You traced the whole path from untrusted source to sink (or reproduced it in the throwaway copy without touching live systems), or the fact is directly observed | `user.bioHtml` saved by `PATCH /profile` and rendered with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unsanitized; a live-format key in `src/` |
| `likely` | Pattern match plus a manual read of the code that shows the weakness, with one link not fully traced | Server Function with no auth check, but you could not see every caller; vulnerable version resolved in the lockfile with the feature in use |
| `possible` | Pattern match only, or a version declared only in `package.json`, or a precondition you could not show | `href={x}` where `x`'s origin is in an unscanned package |

Candidate ranking rule: `possible` can never exceed `medium`. The version script enforces it; you enforce it for manual findings.

A suspicion you cannot show at all goes to notes under "Not confirmed", never to findings.

## Severity (local severity guidance, React mapping)

| Severity | React-specific examples |
| --- | --- |
| `critical` | RSC runtime in the CVE-2025-55182 range on a deployed server; issued server secret in the client bundle; `dangerouslyAllowBrowser` with a live key; unauthenticated Server Function that deletes or writes any user's data; untrusted MDX compiled on the server |
| `high` | Stored XSS through `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, raw markdown, or `innerHTML`; Server Function missing an ownership check; state serialized into a script with user strings; mass assignment of roles; open redirect that executes `javascript:`; RSC DoS advisories |
| `medium` | Reflected XSS needing a crafted link; tokens in localStorage; CSRF behind `SameSite=Lax`; DOMPurify below 3.4.7 with risky options; passthrough Trusted Types policy; open redirect to external sites |
| `low` | Source maps public; unmaintained packages; `target=_blank` without `rel`; error text leaks; taint used as the only layer |
| `info` | React 18 in use (raises RX-02 ratings); current, patched versions worth recording |

Adjustments:

1. Chains: when two findings combine (XSS plus tokens in localStorage), keep each at its own severity and name the other in `why_it_matters`. Do not invent a third finding.
2. Exposure: an admin-only page lowers likelihood but not impact. Lower by one level only when the attacker would already need the same privilege.
3. Next.js overlap: on a Next.js app, do not file Server Action, route handler, middleware, or `next.config` findings; record the exact unsupported server scope in notes; no unavailable specialist is assumed.

## Writing each field

- `title`: what is wrong, in plain words a founder understands. "Anyone can delete any project by calling deleteProject directly." Not "Missing authZ in RSC action".
- `evidence`: a code excerpt of at most 15 lines with `path:line`, or the exact command and output. Redact secrets: `[REDACTED]` without revealing any prefix.
- `why_it_matters`: the consequence for this app, one to three sentences.
- `remediation`: file name and the specific change, ideally a short fixed snippet from the check.
- `effort`: `S` for a one-file fix or patch upgrade, `M` for a new validation layer, auth wrapper, or major-version upgrade, `L` for moving auth to cookies or moving client API calls to a server.
- `refs`: CWE, OWASP 2025 category, CVE or GHSA when relevant, and the check's guide path, for example `security-review/react/guides/02-rsc-and-server-functions.md`.
- `verified_by`: what you read or ran to rule out a false positive.
- `tags`: the check id (`RX-01`), `ai-pattern` when it applies, `react-18` or `rsc` as context.

## Example finding

## metrics-build-studio-react-review.json

```json
{
  "dimension": "security",
  "verdict": "at-risk",
  "summary": "React 19.2 app with an RSC server on a patched runtime; two Server Functions lack ownership checks and one markdown view renders raw HTML.",

}
```

Verdict: the bounded result rule below (any `critical` at `confirmed` or `likely` gives `critical`; any `high` gives `at-risk`; any `medium` or an `at-risk` or `moderate` band gives `moderate`; else no confirmed findings in inspected scope; unresolved caps still prevent blanket clearance). Use `not-run` for unperformed execution or absent applicable React scope, and say why in the summary.

`coverage.caps` must list every limit: `sink_scan.py` per-check caps, files over 2 MB skipped, bun lockfiles not parsed, prerelease builds not compared, paths outside scope, and "no lockfile". An empty array claims no limit applied.
