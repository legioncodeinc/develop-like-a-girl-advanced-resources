# React Security reference index

> Advanced scope: this React catalog applies only to the separate Payload CMS. Other frameworks are conditional comparisons; no React/JSX helper inspects Svelte. Advisory versions remain historical candidates until current supplied primary evidence confirms them.

> Scope: read supplied local evidence with Read/Grep/Glob/Skill and return guidance in chat. The Python helpers, commands, writes, builds, probes and tests below are optional source for a separately authorized caller. If helper output is unavailable, trace the listed checks manually and mark the execution gap. No installation, credential access, provider operation or new assistant/stack is authorized.

> Version qualification: numeric advisory/version/maintenance data is a dated 2026-09-30 offline snapshot, not a current vulnerability database or a safe-version recommendation. Confirm actual installed features, deployment and current primary advisories before promoting a snapshot candidate. Framework SSR does not imply RSC; no RSC runtime, alternate router, MDX engine, sanitizer or telemetry dependency is selected here.

Load when: you need to find which reference holds a check, a table, or a script option.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Key options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `../scripts/react_version_check.py` | lockfile and package.json versions against the advisory table; contract-shaped findings | `--repo`, `--paths`, `--out`, `--summary`, `--start-id`, `--max-files` |
| `../scripts/sink_scan.py` | candidate lines for every check id; secrets redacted | `--repo`, `--paths`, `--out`, `--checks`, `--max-files`, `--max-per-check` |
| `../scripts/test/run_tests.py` | fixture tests for both scripts | none |

Both scripts: Python 3.9+ standard library, read-only on the audited repository, write only where `--out` and `--summary` point.

## Check id prefixes

| Prefix | Area |
| --- | --- |
| RX | XSS and injection sinks in the client |
| RS | Server rendering and hydration injection |
| RC | React Server Components and Server Functions |
| SD | Secrets and data exposure |
| AR | Auth, routing, client trust |
| SC | Supply chain and version behavior |
| AI | AI-generated code patterns (always filed under another id) |

Check ids are internal labels for tags. Finding ids are always `SEC-REACT-NNN`.

Primary technical reference locations: [source index](official-sources.md). Recheck the actual installed version and trust path.
