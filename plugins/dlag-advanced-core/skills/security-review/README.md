# Security Review resource map

Use the complete procedures for the supplied question. This method reviews local evidence and returns a report in chat; it neither executes the examples nor grants remediation, provider, configuration or scanner permissions.

The [security reference](references/research/distilled-security.md) explains the control catalog and evidence limits. The [official source index](references/official-sources.md) supplies primary documentation references; inspect installed versions and actual target configuration before asserting a default/API or current advisory. All procedures, templates and examples needed to use this method are packaged locally.

[Worked security-design cases](examples/security-design/source-cases.md) cover an exported invoice after revocation, a leaking serializer despite a scoped query, lost work after a valid signature, build/log/context exposure and green unit tests that leave actual tenant/payment risk untested. They are synthetic reasoning cases, not application or model-runtime proof.

## Available neighboring methods

Use Core `data-foundation` and `identity` for the actual selected schema/auth design, `r2-storage` for storage implementation, `dependency-review` for exact supplied dependency/advisory evidence and `project-notebook` for accepted requirements and contract context. Consult `dlag-advanced-app-builder:stripe-payments` only when the App Builder plugin is installed and optional custom payments are selected. A failed namespaced Skill call is an unavailable prerequisite, not dispatch evidence. No sibling plugin cache path is assumed. Quality Review follows Security Review; the orchestrator owns the final repository-health review.

## React-specific depth

The complete [React security method](react/playbook.md) and [guide map](react/README.md) retain detailed XSS/SSR, client trust, data exposure, conditional Server Function boundaries, per-check code pairs, lockfile parsing and bounded candidate scanning. Advisory data is an offline snapshot and helpers do not run from this read-only role.

## Additional complete review methods

- [Backend, dependencies, source secrets and delivery controls](polyglot/playbook.md), including concrete SvelteKit/Neon boundaries and conditional ecosystem check/code references. The source-only helpers do not run from this role.
- [Passive supplied-response review](passive/playbook.md): headers, cookies, coarse transport observations, exposure and payment-path observations. Optional public collection is an explicitly authorized caller operation, not an audit result or a default network action.
- [Request and rendering boundary catalogs](framework-boundaries/playbook.md): verified actor/owner, independent endpoints, serialization/validation echoes, caches, streams, uploads and exception boundaries, with twelve concrete vulnerable/fixed cases. Other framework-specific APIs, configuration and advisory datasets are not Advanced defaults.

Each method returns actual scope, evidence and missing proof. A parameterized parser or manual checklist does not establish framework discovery, a current advisory verdict, a running target, effective policies, or native/model behavior.

## Advanced application and CMS

Read [the preserved Advanced workflow](guides/advanced-workflow.md), [SvelteKit procedure](guides/02-sveltekit-attack-surface.md), [seven concrete request cases](references/advanced-request-cases.md) and [Payload/Next CMS procedure](guides/16-payload-next-boundary.md). React catalogs/helpers apply only to the separate CMS React surface. They do not scan Svelte templates or establish complete Next.js advisory coverage. The historical Workers example remains comparison material, never an Advanced default.
