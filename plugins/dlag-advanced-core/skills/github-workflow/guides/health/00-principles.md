# 00 - Principles and Boundaries

> Evidence-only audit: this role uses supplied local files and dated owner-provided settings/API/run exports. It does not execute Git/gh/shell, authenticate, request tokens, contact GitHub, run workflows, inspect credentials, write reports/settings or apply fixes. Commands and API shapes below are proposals for a separate authorized collection owner. Missing evidence is unknown/N/A, never proof of an absent or perfect control. Examples are illustrative, not actual repository findings.

## §1 Audit-only boundary

`GitHub Workflow` is a read-only auditor. It inspects repository metadata and produces findings. It never:
- Modifies branch protection rules or rulesets
- Edits CI workflow files
- Commits, pushes, or opens PRs
- Changes repository settings via the API

Every recommendation is phrased as an action the *human* (or a named downstream reviewer) should take. Phrasing: "Recommend enabling auto-delete-head-branches in Settings > General > Pull Requests" - not "I'll enable auto-delete-head-branches."

## §2 API scope declaration

Every audit report must open with a one-line scope declaration:

```
**Data collection mode:** supplied local files | supplied dated settings/API/run export (collector/action scope stated) | combination of supplied evidence; no live collection by this role
**Coverage gaps:** {any dimensions unavailable due to API scope}
```

Branch protection, CODEOWNERS enforcement and settings need actual current configured-state evidence, such as a dated authorized export. Without it, report unable to verify with the exact missing evidence; do not ask for credentials or silently score zero.

## §3 Scoring and prioritization

- Score each of the eight dimensions on a 0-10 scale using the rubric in the dimension's guide.
- Full coverage: score = 10 × sum(raw score × decimal weight). For partial coverage, divide that weighted sum by the assessed decimal weight before multiplying by 10, label partial and disclose assessed weight. No assessed dimensions means no score. Branching stays qualitative; automation is supplemental, not a ninth dimension.
- Build the remediation list ordered by `impact ÷ effort`:
  - **Impact:** how much does fixing this improve repo health? (1-5)
  - **Effort:** how many minutes/hours does the fix take? (1=minutes, 5=weeks)
  - **Priority score:** impact ÷ effort (higher = act first)

Do not order findings by dimension number. A "no CODEOWNERS" finding (effort: 1, impact: 4, priority: 4.0) should appear above "PR template is empty" (effort: 1, impact: 2, priority: 2.0).

## §4 Handoff rules

| Domain | This reviewer's scope | Handoff to |
|---|---|---|
| CI workflow gaps (missing typecheck/test) | Surface the gap, name the handoff | `the authorized CI implementation owner` |
| CI workflow architecture (reusable workflows, release pipeline) | Out of scope | `the authorized CI implementation owner` |
| Secret scanning result details | Check if enabled | `Security Review` |
| Code logic / security vulnerabilities | Out of scope | `Security Review` |
| Neon/Postgres dataset schema | Out of scope | `the accepted database owner` |
| PRD / doc authoring | Out of scope | `Project Notebook or the accepted documentation owner` |
| Post-audit verification | Out of scope | `Quality Review` |

## §5 Impact divided by effort priority scoring table

For reference when building the remediation list:

| Finding | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| No branch protection on default branch | 5 | 1 | 5.0 |
| No CODEOWNERS | 4 | 1 | 4.0 |
| Secret scanning disabled | 4 | 1 | 4.0 |
| Push protection disabled | 4 | 1 | 4.0 |
| Auto-delete branches off | 3 | 1 | 3.0 |
| No issue templates | 3 | 2 | 1.5 |
| No PR template | 3 | 1 | 3.0 |
| 0% Conventional Commits adherence | 4 | 3 | 1.3 |
| Missing CONTRIBUTING.md | 2 | 1 | 2.0 |
| Missing SECURITY.md | 3 | 1 | 3.0 |
| All merge types allowed | 3 | 1 | 3.0 |
| .gitignore missing or incomplete | 3 | 1 | 3.0 |
| CI has no test stage | 4 | 2 | 2.0 |

This table is a starting-point heuristic. Adjust for repo-specific context (e.g., a team with a different accepted commit convention needs its policy recorded before interpreting adherence. Do not invent an impact or implementation duration.


For a full audit, unavailable dimensions are N/A with coverage gaps. Do not manufacture zero or perfect scores from missing API/settings evidence. Use the coverage-aware formula in [guide 10](10-review-automation-permissions.md); the supplemental automation review creates no ninth dimension.
