How to rewrite vague, aggressive, or ambiguous review comments into the three-tier framing (blocker / suggestion / nit) with a rationale. Covers the "question not demand" heuristic, tone calibration, and worked rewrites.

## Why comment coaching matters

A review comment is a communication act between two engineers. When the comment is vague ("this is wrong"), aggressive ("why would you do this?"), or untierced ("fix this"), the author spends cognitive load guessing the reviewer's intent instead of fixing the code. Comment coaching transforms that communication friction into clarity without losing the technical substance.

The review-as-mentorship lens changes the frame: every comment is an opportunity for both the reviewer and the author to become better engineers. A well-written comment teaches; a poorly-written comment defends.

## The three-step coaching process

When coaching a review comment, apply these three steps:

### Step 1: Identify the tier

Classify the original comment as `blocker:`, `suggestion:`, or `nit:` based on its intent. If the original comment is materially ambiguous, preserve that uncertainty and ask for the intended tier; do not guess or invert the reviewer's technical position.

**Decision rule:** Would this issue cause a bug, security hole, or design regression if merged unaddressed? → `blocker:`. Would it improve the code but is not a merge gate? → `suggestion:`. Is it cosmetic? → `nit:`.

### Step 2: Separate the code from the person

Rewrite all person-directed language ("you wrote", "why did you", "you should") to code-directed language ("this function", "this pattern", "the approach here").

### Step 3: Add the "what" and the "why"

A complete comment names (a) what the issue is, (b) what tier it is, and (c) why it matters or what a fix looks like. All three elements must be present.

## Worked rewrites

### Vague comment
**Before:** "This seems wrong."
**After:** `suggestion:` `validateEmail` accepts any string without checking for the `@` symbol. A malformed address can propagate to later notification handling instead of producing a clear input error. Suggest adding `if (!email.includes('@')) return { valid: false, error: 'Invalid email format' }` before the database write.

---

### Aggressive comment
**Before:** "Why would you use a raw SQL query here? That's dangerous."
**After:** `blocker:` This query concatenates caller-controlled identity into SQL. Use the accepted parameterized query or Drizzle query-builder path, then separately enforce the authenticated customer's record ownership. An escaping helper name alone is not proof of safe query construction. Ask the authorized implementation owner to show the actual boundary and tests; Security Review owns the finding.

---

### Ambiguous tier comment
**Before:** "Consider using a constant for this magic number."
**After:** `nit:` The `432000` in `session_ttl = 432000` is not self-documenting. Suggest extracting to `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS = 60 * 60 * 24 * 5` (5 days) for readability. Not a merge gate - happy to leave this for a follow-up if it's out of scope.

---

### Demand rewritten as question
**Before:** "You need to add error handling here."
**After:** `blocker:` If `fetchUserProfile` rejects (e.g., network timeout), the caller receives an unhandled failure and the promised response path is missing. Have you considered adding a try/catch here, or would a `Promise.allSettled` pattern fit better given the surrounding code? Either works - flagging because this is a merge gate.

---

### Praise comment (reinforcing good patterns)
**Before:** (no comment at all on a good decision)
**After:** `praise:` Good call verifying the webhook signature before updating payment entitlement. The server-side boundary is explicit and makes the denied-path behavior reviewable. Document the accepted signature and ownership checks alongside the test evidence.

---

## The "question not demand" heuristic

When in doubt, frame the comment as a question. "Have you considered X?" is less defensive than "You should do X." Both surface the same concern, but the question form:

- Acknowledges that the author may have considered and rejected the suggestion
- Invites dialogue rather than compliance
- Reduces the emotional cost of receiving the comment

Apply this heuristic for `suggestion:` and `nit:` tier comments. For `blocker:` comments, be direct - the merge is at stake and clarity matters more than softness.

---

## When NOT to soften a blocker

A `blocker:` comment should be direct. Over-softening a blocker creates ambiguity about whether the author must act before merging.

**Too soft (creates ambiguity):**
> `blocker:` Maybe we should think about adding auth here? Just a thought.

**Appropriately direct:**
> `blocker:` This endpoint does not check for authentication. Any unauthenticated caller can access user data. Auth middleware must be added before this merges. See how `api/users.ts` handles it.

The goal is directness without aggression. The issue is the code, not the developer.

[Google's review-comment guidance](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/comments.html) supports clear rationale and comments about the code. The exact tier vocabulary here is the team-facing convention; it is not a claim that every label is mandated by that source.
