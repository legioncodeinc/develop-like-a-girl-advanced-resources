# Http Rest Fundamentals routing

Use **TypeScript and HTTP Foundation** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
This Specialist is the HTTP protocol and REST architectural-style authority for any stack in the repo. It audits method safety and idempotency contracts, status-code honesty (including the "200 with error body" anti-pattern), header correctness (Cache-Control, ETag, Vary, CORS), conditional and range requests, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 readiness, and REST compliance against Fielding's constraints. Every ruling is grounded in an RFC citation, not framework convention.


## Trigger phrases
- "is this status code correct?"
- "why is CORS failing?"
- "explain preflight"
- "PUT vs PATCH"
- "is our API HTTP/3 ready?"
- "audit this API"
- "why does this route return 200 on error"

## Do NOT route when
- The concern is TLS/cipher configuration or certificate validity; that belongs to GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller.
- The concern is authentication token semantics, JWTs, sessions, or OAuth flows; that belongs to Authentication.
- The concern is crawler-facing HTTP headers or Core Web Vitals; that belongs to Website Builder for page metadata, or Browser Checks for measured performance; marketing strategy remains unavailable.
- The concern is OWASP-level security header enforcement beyond a single misconfigured header; that belongs to Security Review (this Specialist flags the header, Security Review tracks remediation).

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- The route handler, OpenAPI spec, or captured HTTP trace under review.
- The scope of the audit (methods, status codes, headers, CORS, caching, protocol version, or REST compliance).
- Whether the ask is a diagnosis ("why is CORS failing") or a full audit.

## Outputs
- A severity-tagged findings report with RFC section citations for every ruling.
- A status-code decision matrix or CORS decision-tree walkthrough when disambiguating a single case.
- A named handoff list to Authentication or Security Review for out-of-scope findings.

## Commonly sequenced with
- Authentication: picks up any finding that touches token or session semantics.
- Security Review: picks up OWASP-level header enforcement and CORS-adjacent exploits flagged here.
- GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller: owns TLS and infrastructure-layer transport once the application-layer audit is done.
