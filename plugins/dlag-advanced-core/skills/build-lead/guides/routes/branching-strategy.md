# Branching Strategy routing

Use **GitHub Workflow** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
Owns the strategic and tactical decisions behind how this repo structures its version-control workflow: branching model selection (trunk-based, GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow, GitFlow), migration between models, release and hotfix branch patterns, the merge-vs-rebase call, the long-lived-branch trap, and the feature-flag vs feature-branch decision. Defaults to GitHub Flow for this Advanced project; another model requires an explicit team constraint and decision. Never introduce GitFlow without justification. Produces a branching policy document, not pipeline or ruleset configuration.


## Trigger phrases
- "which branching model should we use"
- "we have too many merge conflicts"
- "our release process is broken"
- "GitFlow or trunk-based, which fits us"
- "merge or rebase, what's our policy"
- "should this be a feature flag or a branch"
- "set up GitHub Merge Queue"
- "our branches sit open for weeks"

## Do NOT route when
- The request is Git mechanics: interactive rebase, conflict resolution, history rewriting; that is GitHub Workflow.
- The request is branch protection ruleset configuration in GitHub/GitLab; that is GitHub Workflow, not GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller.
- The request is CI/CD pipeline topology, including adding a `merge_group:` trigger for a merge queue; that is GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller.
- The request is choosing a feature-flag platform (LaunchDarkly vs Unleash vs Statsig) or writing flag implementation code; this Specialist scopes the flag-vs-branch decision only, then routes implementation to Svelte Foundation or a separately qualified Python caller; Python implementation is not selected.
- The team just shipped a release under a new model and wants release notes; that is Project Notebook for an authorized release draft; publishing or a dedicated changelog engine is unavailable.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- Release cadence, team size, product type, and whether multi-version support is required.
- Existing feature-flag infrastructure, or lack of it.
- A `git log --graph`, branch list, or `.github/` folder if available, inspected before asking further questions.

## Outputs
- A branching policy document (`docs/engineering/branching-policy.md`) covering model, naming, merge strategy, hotfix/release protocol, and feature-flag policy.
- A model recommendation with the GitFlow-bias explicitly stated and a merge-vs-rebase ruling.
- A routed list of protection-ruleset and CI-trigger deltas for the appropriate sibling Specialists.

## Commonly sequenced with
- GitHub Workflow: handles the rebase mechanics and conflict resolution once the model is chosen.
- GitHub Workflow: configures the branch protection rulesets this Specialist's policy calls for.
- GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller: wires CI pipeline triggers, including merge-queue support.
- Project Notebook for an authorized release draft; publishing or a dedicated changelog engine is unavailable: communicates releases once the new branching/release model produces one.
