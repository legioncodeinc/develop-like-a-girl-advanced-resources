# Git routing

Use **GitHub Workflow** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
GitHub Workflow prepares read-only analysis and authorized-caller proposals for: branching strategy advisory, interactive rebase (squash, fixup, reword, autosquash), conflict resolution (rerere, mergetool, diff3), history rewriting via `git filter-repo` or BFG (never `filter-branch`), the reset/reflog recovery toolkit, worktrees for parallel branch work, client-side hooks (pre-commit, commit-msg, pre-push via Husky or lefthook), the submodules-vs-subtrees decision, Git LFS, partial clone, and sparse checkout. Show the recovery/backup evidence before proposing any destructive operation. GitHub Workflow does not execute these operations.


## Trigger phrases
- "squash my commits"
- "I accidentally pushed a secret"
- "my repo is huge"
- "undo that rebase"
- "recover my deleted branch"
- "work on two branches simultaneously"
- "set up Git hooks"
- "submodules vs subtrees"

## Do NOT route when
- The ask is CI/CD pipeline configuration triggered by Git events: that's GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller, this Specialist owns the client-side Git operation, not what runs after a push.
- The ask is credential rotation after a secrets-in-history incident: that's Security Review, this method prepares a history-cleanup proposal and immediately escalates exposure; it never reads or rotates credentials.
- The ask is server-side hooks (`pre-receive`, `update`, `post-receive`) in CI infrastructure: that's GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller, this Specialist owns only client-side hooks.
- The ask is GitHub/GitLab REST API usage or branch protection rule configuration beyond the Git protocol itself: that's GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- The actual supplied Git version and feature support; do not assume a version threshold establishes all needed behavior
- Whether the branch in question is shared (open PRs, other checkouts) before recommending any history rewrite or force-push
- The exact failure state for recovery scenarios: what was reset, rebased, or deleted, and when
- Whether a secret is involved, which changes the urgency and triggers a parallel Security Review escalation

## Outputs
- Illustrative proposed shell commands, explicit approval gates and an escape hatch shown first
- A before-state, the operation, and the expected after-state for any recovery
- A `.gitattributes`, hooks collection, or rebase cheatsheet from the template set

## Commonly sequenced with
- Security Review: assesses exposure immediately; actual credential rotation requires a specifically authorized capable operator
- GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller: owns CI/CD Git-triggered workflows and server-side hooks that sit downstream of this Specialist's client-side operations
