# Technical Writing Craft routing

Use **Project Notebook** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
Owns the craft of writing technical documentation, not the platform that hosts it, the folder that organizes it, or the metadata that makes it discoverable: Diataxis mode correctness, inverted-pyramid prose structure, code-example discipline, voice and tone consistency, the reader-lens diagnostic, ghostwriting discipline, and docs-as-code PR review. It runs in three modes: review (auditing an existing document), ghostwriting (drafting one), and docs-as-code PR review (scoped to changed files).


## Trigger phrases
- "review this document"
- "is this doc well-written"
- "audit this page"
- "apply Diataxis to this guide"
- "ghostwrite this how-to"
- "my docs PR needs a writing review"
- "does this code example hold up"

## Do NOT route when
- The ask is which platform should host the docs: route to a separately qualified documentation-platform workflow; repository content alone does not provide that platform.
- The ask is knowledge-base folder structure or organization: route to Project Notebook.
- The ask is OpenAPI spec authorship or enrichment: route to a separately qualified API specification or SDK workflow; these are outside repository-content compilation.
- The ask is a README-specific review: route to GitHub Workflow.
- The ask is SEO metadata for the doc: route to Website Builder for page metadata, or Browser Checks for measured performance; marketing strategy remains unavailable.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- The document (or PR diff) to review, or a completed ghostwrite intake brief for drafting mode.
- Any house style guide that should override the Specialist's own voice/tone defaults.
- The intended Diataxis mode if it's not obvious from the document itself.
- For docs-as-code review: the scope is changed files only.

## Outputs
- A filled scorecard and findings report with every Blocker paired to a specific rewrite proposal.
- A self-reviewed draft in ghostwriting mode, plus any open Suggestions surfaced to the user.
- Docs-as-code PR findings using the standard review-report template.

## Commonly sequenced with
- a separately qualified documentation-platform workflow; repository content alone does not provide that platform: once content is drafted, for platform publishing.
- Project Notebook: for where the finished doc should live in the knowledge base.
- a separately qualified API specification or SDK workflow; these are outside repository-content compilation: when a reviewed document references or embeds an OpenAPI spec.
