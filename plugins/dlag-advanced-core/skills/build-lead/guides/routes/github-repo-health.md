# Github Repo Health routing

Use **GitHub Workflow** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
This Specialist is a read-only repository hygiene auditor for GitHub repos. It scores eight dimensions: branch protection rulesets, PR culture, commit history quality (Conventional Commits adherence), CI workflow density, README/docs presence, `.gitignore` coverage, CODEOWNERS patterns, issue/PR templates, and repository settings (merge strategy, secret scanning, auto-delete). It never modifies branch protection, CI files, or settings; it produces a scored audit report ranked by impact divided by effort.


## Trigger phrases
- "audit this repo"
- "repo health check"
- "check branch protection"
- "CODEOWNERS audit"
- "are our CI checks configured correctly"
- "check PR templates"
- "GitHub repo hygiene"
- "is our git workflow healthy"

## Do NOT route when
- The ask is deep CI/CD architecture beyond checking whether workflows exist: that's GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller, this Specialist only scores workflow density and hands off architecture depth.
- The ask is code correctness or security vulnerabilities in the code itself: that's Security Review, this Specialist only checks whether secret scanning is enabled, not what a leak means.
- The ask is database schema: that's Data Foundation, entirely outside this Specialist's metadata-layer scope.
- The ask is README content quality or structural rewriting: that's GitHub Workflow, this Specialist only checks presence and basic quality signals.
- The user wants automated fixes applied (e.g. "enable branch protection for me"): this Specialist is read-only, it drafts the manual steps or names the GitHub Settings path instead.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- The available data collection mode: local clone plus `gh` CLI, GitHub REST API with a `repo`-scoped token, or local clone only
- Whether the audit is full (all eight dimensions) or scoped to specific ones
- Repo visibility, since private repos without API access limit branch protection and CODEOWNERS coverage checks
- CODEOWNERS file content, to flag references to non-existent teams or users rather than silently skip them

## Outputs
- A scored audit report (0-10 per dimension, weighted to a 0-100 overall score) at `library/requirements/reports/github-repo-health/<date>-<repo-slug>-audit.md`
- A remediation plan ranked by impact divided by effort, with named responsible parties
- Explicit handoff names for CI architecture, secret scanning results, and README structure gaps

## Commonly sequenced with
- GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller: receives CI architecture depth findings this Specialist's density check surfaces but doesn't resolve
- Security Review: receives secret-scanning-enabled findings for the leak-implication audit
- GitHub Workflow: receives README structural improvement findings


## Automation permission hygiene

Route scoped automation/permission-risk review here using the current owner's local Playbook. Output observations with exact source paths/revisions, authority boundaries and missing candidate proof. Unknown live settings stay unknown. No workflow execution or repair. Security owns vulnerability implications; Broader release/workflow implementation requires a designated capable caller. This does not authorize repository or provider changes.
