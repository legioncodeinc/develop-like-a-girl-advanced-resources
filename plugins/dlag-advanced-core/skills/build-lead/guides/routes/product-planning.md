# Product Planning routing

Use **Project Planning** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



Check the generated roster and actual registered namespaced Playbook before work.
**Trigger policy:** on-demand

## Domain

This Specialist turns an approved Product Strategy and UX package into the build plan: a PRD map with dependencies and shared boundaries, a dependency-ordered wave plan saved at `library/requirements/plans/wave-plan.md` with a Mermaid graph and entry and exit criteria, the project Definition of Done at `library/knowledge/private/standards/definition-of-done.md`, and a handoff packet for Project Notebook and Build Lead, with shared-boundary acceptance evidence. Each artifact is approved by the owner by revision before anything downstream uses it.

## Trigger phrases

- "plan the build"
- "wave plan"
- "definition of done"
- "what order do we build in"
- "break this into PRDs"
- "prepare a dependency-ordered build plan"

## Do NOT route when

- Writing the actual PRDs/IRDs belongs to Project Notebook.
- Shared contract terms need the scope guide's acceptance process. No contract-author Specialist is packaged.
- Executing a plan needs Build Lead and an available implementer with actual tools.
- Record new feature ideas as scope decisions. Process coaching is outside this method; estimation remains Project Planning.

If a request straddles two Specialists' domains, prefer the narrower-scoped Specialist and let the broader one act as backup.

## Inputs the Specialist needs

- The approved Product Strategy
- The approved UX package, or the owner's written OK to plan without one
- Existing PRDs and accepted CTRs, if any

If a required input is missing, do not invoke yet; ask the owner to supply it.

## Outputs the Specialist produces

- `library/requirements/plans/prd-map.md`
- `library/requirements/plans/wave-plan.md`
- `library/knowledge/private/standards/definition-of-done.md`
- `library/requirements/plans/handoff-packet.md`

## Multi-Specialist sequences this Specialist participates in

- Plan a product: step 3. Hands the approved packet to Project Notebook and Build Lead. Record shared-boundary acceptance through the scope guide before dependent work. No separate contract author or session manager is implied.

## Critical directives the orchestrator should respect

- The owner approves each artifact before the next stage uses it.
- This planning mode prepares the approved decision and handoff; actual PRD authorship belongs to Project Notebook, shared-boundary acceptance follows the scope guide, and application code needs a qualified implementer.
