# Csv Xlsx Import Export routing

Use **Application Data UI** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
Implements and audits the "upload your spreadsheet" feature surface for Svelte products: CSV/XLSX parsing (papaparse, SheetJS, exceljs), large-file streaming via the Web Worker + chunk pattern, column-mapping UX (the 5-stage wizard, a local Svelte mapping flow; managed importers require explicit provider selection), per-row Zod validation with structured error objects, CSV injection prevention (CWE-1236), encoding edge cases (UTF-8 BOM, CP1252), and styled XLSX export via ExcelJS WorkbookWriter.


## Trigger phrases
- "build a CSV import for this app"
- "add XLSX upload with column mapping"
- "we need a column-mapping wizard"
- "export this data to Excel"
- "stream-parse a large CSV without freezing the browser"
- "is our CSV export safe from injection"
- "handle UTF-8 BOM and CP1252 encoding on import"
- "define a local mapping flow without adding an importer vendor"

## Do NOT route when
- The request is the file drop-zone UI component itself; that is Design Foundation. This Specialist owns the parse/validate/export logic behind it.
- The request is database bulk-insert performance once rows are validated; that is Data Foundation.
- The request is a security audit of the upload endpoint; that is Security Review, and this Specialist explicitly hands off to it before any upload endpoint reaches production.
- File size exceeds 500 MB, requiring a server-side pipeline with object storage; this Specialist does not own that background-job architecture.
- The user needs HIPAA compliance with a managed importer; verify BAA availability or the self-hosted path before proceeding, don't assume.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- Format(s) in scope (CSV, XLSX, or both), max expected file size, and whether column mapping is needed.
- Validation rules and the output target (Svelte state, API, or DB).
- Export requirements, if the request includes generating downloadable files.

## Outputs
- Parse/streaming code (papaparse/SheetJS/exceljs) with a Web Worker strategy for files over 5 MB.
- A column-mapping wizard (managed or self-hosted) and a Zod validation layer with row-level error objects.
- Sanitized CSV/XLSX export code and a findings report at the current owner's local Playbook covering library decisions and the sanitization checklist.

## Commonly sequenced with
- Design Foundation: builds the drop-zone and wizard UI shell this Specialist's logic plugs into.
- Data Foundation: handles bulk-insert performance for validated rows this Specialist produces.
- Security Review: audits the upload endpoint before production, mandatory handoff every time.
