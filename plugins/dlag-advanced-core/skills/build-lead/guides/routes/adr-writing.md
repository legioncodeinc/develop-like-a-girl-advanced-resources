# Adr Writing routing

Use **Project Notebook** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
Owns the Architecture Decision Record corpus: drafting new ADRs in Nygard format by default (Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives Considered), switching to MADR or Y-statements when the team's conventions call for it, assigning sequential numbers, and superseding stale decisions with bidirectional links. Enforces the "decisions, not docs" test so the ADR log stays a scannable, trustworthy onboarding artifact instead of a dumping ground for design proposals.


## Trigger phrases
- "write an ADR for this decision"
- "record this decision before we forget why"
- "supersede ADR-0032"
- "set up our ADR log"
- "which ADR format should we use, Nygard or MADR"
- "document this architecture choice"
- "how do new engineers read our ADR log"
- "audit our ADR directory for completeness"

## Do NOT route when
- The request is general knowledge-base authorship, not a closed decision record; that is Project Notebook.
- The request is extracting code entities into a wiki; that is Project Notebook for narrative documentation; automated entity extraction needs a separately qualified tool.
- The request is a security review of the decision's posture (auth, secrets, PII, data residency); that is Security Review, though this Specialist still records the decision first and then escalates.
- The user is describing an in-flight proposal or a design discussion, not a closed decision; redirect to an RFC or PRD instead of drafting an ADR.
- The ADR log needs CI/CD or documentation-site integration; that is GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- The decision itself, stated as closed and consequential (not a brainstorm).
- Path to the existing ADR directory, or confirmation none exists yet.
- For supersession requests, the ADR number being replaced.

## Outputs
- A numbered ADR file (`NNNN-<kebab-title>.md`) in the project's ADR directory.
- An updated ADR log index (`adr-log.md` or Log4brains build).
- For supersession, both records updated with bidirectional status links.

## Commonly sequenced with
- Security Review: reviews the decision's security posture after this Specialist records it, when auth/secrets/PII are touched.
- Project Notebook: takes design proposals or in-flight discussions that fail the "decisions, not docs" test.
- GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller: wires the finished ADR log into CI/CD or a docs site.
