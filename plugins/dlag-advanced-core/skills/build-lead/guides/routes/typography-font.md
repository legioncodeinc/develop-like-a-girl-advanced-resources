# Typography Font routing

Use **Design Foundation** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
Owns the technical typographic surface of web products: font-loading strategy (approved hosted fonts, Fontsource, self-hosted, system fallbacks), variable font subsetting and `font-display` rules, fluid type scales built with `clamp()`, vertical rhythm via `line-height` and spacing tokens, and the font-token layer consumed by the design system. It owns `font-display` and preload strategy where typography overlaps LCP performance, but hands the Core Web Vitals measurement loop off.


## Trigger phrases
- "set up fonts for this project"
- "audit our typography"
- "fix FOIT/FOUT"
- "build a type scale"
- "qualify a SvelteKit/Vite font loading change"
- "self-host our fonts"
- "set up fluid type with clamp"
- "our variable font is 600kB, what do we do"

## Do NOT route when
- The ask is typeface selection or the brand's typographic identity itself: route to Design Foundation.
- The ask is applying already-defined type tokens to a specific component: route to Design Foundation.
- The ask is build-pipeline font optimization such as `glyphhanger` running in CI: route to GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller.
- The ask is the data schema for persisted user font preferences: route to Data Foundation.
- The ask is the broader Core Web Vitals/LCP audit beyond `font-display` and preload strategy: route to Website Builder for page metadata, or Browser Checks for measured performance; marketing strategy remains unavailable.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- The current font setup: which fonts, how loaded (CDN, Fontsource, raw `@font-face`), and the framework.
- Whether the font is a paid/licensed typeface with confirmed subsetting permission.
- The target min/max viewport range for a fluid type scale.
- The actual SvelteKit SSR/Vite loading boundary and applicable asset configuration.

## Outputs
- `@font-face` and selected-stack preload configuration with explicit `font-display`.
- A `clamp()`-based fluid type scale and vertical-rhythm token set.
- A `tokens/typography.css` file following the primitive/semantic/component tier architecture.
- A structured audit report covering FOIT/FOUT/FOFT findings and font payload budget.

## Commonly sequenced with
- Design Foundation: for the typeface/brand decision this Specialist's technical implementation serves.
- Design Foundation: for applying the resulting type tokens at the component level.
- Website Builder for page metadata, or Browser Checks for measured performance; marketing strategy remains unavailable: for the Core Web Vitals measurement loop once `font-display` and preload are set.
