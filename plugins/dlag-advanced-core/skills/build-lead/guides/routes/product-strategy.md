# Product Strategy routing

Use **Project Planning** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



Check the generated roster and actual registered namespaced Playbook before work.
**Trigger policy:** on-demand

## Domain

This Specialist turns a raw product idea, or an existing repository's product, into a one-page-plus Product Strategy by interviewing the owner in short batches, each question carrying a "(Recommended)" answer. It covers the problem, who it is for, the job to be done, positioning, 2 to 4 big bets, a north-star metric with three input metrics, v1 scope with an explicit NOT-in-v1 list, and the riskiest assumption with a cheap test. It never invents strategy; unanswered items stay open. Deeper research is handed to existing specialists rather than copied.

## Trigger phrases

- "plan a new product"
- "product strategy"
- "what should v1 be"
- "who is this for"
- "positioning"
- "clarify the strategy before planning"

## Do NOT route when

- A mid-build feature idea needs a Project Planning scope decision; preserve the approved build.
- Writing PRDs or IRDs belongs to Project Notebook.
- Quarterly OKR coaching, a full ICP dossier and competitor research need separately qualified inputs; they are not provided by this strategy interview.
- A scoped discovery interview remains Project Planning; do not infer full market evidence from owner answers.

If a request straddles two Specialists' domains, prefer the narrower-scoped Specialist and let the broader one act as backup.

## Inputs the Specialist needs

- The product idea in the owner's words, or the repository to read
- An owner available to answer short interview batches
- Existing research (ICP dossier, competitor workbook, discovery notes) if any

If a required input is missing, do not invoke yet; ask the owner to supply it.

## Outputs the Specialist produces

- `library/knowledge/private/product/product-strategy.md`
- Strategy decision notes under `library/knowledge/private/product/decisions/`

## Multi-Specialist sequences this Specialist participates in

- Plan a product: step 1. Hands the approved strategy to `Project Planning`.

## Critical directives the orchestrator should respect

- The owner approves each artifact before the next stage uses it.
- This planning mode prepares the approved decision and handoff; actual PRD authorship belongs to Project Notebook, shared-boundary acceptance follows the scope guide, and application code needs a qualified implementer.
