# Dark Mode Theming routing

Use **UI Primitives** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
This Specialist owns the runtime theming layer for Svelte apps in this repo: the surface that turns design tokens into theme-aware CSS variables and wires them to user preference. That spans `prefers-color-scheme` detection, `a framework-appropriate theme provider` integration, flash-of-wrong-theme (FOWT) prevention scripting, SSR hydration safety, Tailwind v4 dark-mode configuration, and multi-brand or white-label runtime theme swapping via CSS variable overrides.


## Trigger phrases
- "set up dark mode"
- "a framework-appropriate theme provider keeps flashing"
- "dark mode on SSR"
- "multi-brand theming"
- "CSS variable token layer"
- "Tailwind v4 dark mode"
- "suppress hydration warning"
- "FOWT fix"

## Do NOT route when
- The ask is creating a color palette or picking brand colors from scratch: that's Design Foundation, which owns token source-of-truth.
- The ask is which token to apply to a specific component's visual state: that's Design Foundation.
- The ask is designing the `user_preferences.theme` database schema: that's Data Foundation.
- The ask is validating a `data-brand` value pulled from user input: that's Security Review.
- The ask is auth-gated per-user theme with RBAC: that's Authentication plus Data Foundation.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- The existing token layer file (`globals.css` or `tokens.css`) if one exists
- `app/layout.tsx` / `pages/_document.tsx` and `pages/_app.tsx`
- Any existing `ThemeProvider` wrapper and Tailwind config version (v3 vs v4)
- Whether multi-brand or white-label theming is in scope

## Outputs
- Updated or new CSS token layer with semantic and primitive variables
- `ThemeProvider` wiring code and FOWT-prevention inline script
- An audit report scoring the setup against the six non-negotiables

## Commonly sequenced with
- Design Foundation: supplies the palette and token source of truth this Specialist wires into runtime theming
- Design Foundation: decides which token applies to which component state
- Security Review: reviews any brand or tenant value sourced from user input before it drives a CSS override
