# Code Review Pr routing

Use **GitHub Workflow** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
Owns code review as a culture and practice: PR description quality against a canonical six-element structure (motivation, context, what changed, what did NOT change, testing proof, reviewer hints), context-specific review checklist generation, PR size evaluation against a 400-line threshold with split strategies, rubber-stamp culture diagnosis, and coaching review comments into a three-tier taxonomy (blocker/suggestion/nit). Never approves or blocks a merge; merge decisions stay with humans and CI.


## Trigger phrases
- "audit our PR culture"
- "write a PR description for this diff"
- "create a review checklist for this change"
- "coach this review comment, it sounds too harsh"
- "is this PR too large, should I split it"
- "how do we improve code review on our team"
- "why do our reviews feel like rubber stamps"
- "review this PR for description quality"

## Do NOT route when
- The request is security audit findings; that is Security Review.
- The request is implementation correctness at the logic level; that is a separately qualified Python caller; Python implementation is not selected or Svelte Foundation.
- The request is CI/CD pipeline setup; that is GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller.
- The request is branch protection configuration or enforcing a PR template at the repository-settings level; that is GitHub Workflow.
- A review comment being coached contains an actual security finding; surface it separately to Security Review rather than just softening the tone.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- The PR diff or description, and which request type applies (description audit, checklist, size evaluation, culture diagnosis, comment coaching).
- File types present in the diff, to scope a context-specific checklist.
- For culture audits, repo-level metrics access (zero-comment PR rate, review latency) or a GitHub API token.

## Outputs
- A scored PR description audit table (pass/fail/warn per element) plus a rewrite.
- A context-specific three-phase review checklist.
- A size-evaluation flag with a concrete split proposal, or a culture scorecard with a remediation plan.

## Commonly sequenced with
- Security Review: takes any security finding surfaced mid-comment-coaching.
- a separately qualified Python caller; Python implementation is not selected / Svelte Foundation: own implementation correctness that this Specialist's checklists point at but do not judge themselves.
- GitHub Workflow: enforces PR templates and branch protection at the settings level that this Specialist only coaches content for.
- GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller: owns the CI checks that a review checklist references but does not configure.
