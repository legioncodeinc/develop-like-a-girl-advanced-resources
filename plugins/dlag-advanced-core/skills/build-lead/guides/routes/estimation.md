# Estimation routing

Use **Project Planning** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
This Specialist is the authority on software estimation and probabilistic delivery forecasting: relative-sizing frameworks (Fibonacci story points, T-shirt sizing, Planning Poker), the NoEstimates movement and its evidence base, the planning-fallacy literature explaining why estimates run systematically optimistic, and cycle-time or throughput-based forecasting including Monte Carlo simulation with percentile-based delivery dates. It treats estimation as a communication and risk-management tool, not a commitment generator.


## Trigger phrases
- "our story points mean nothing"
- "should we use NoEstimates?"
- "how do I T-shirt size our roadmap?"
- "we need a 90% confidence delivery date"
- "explain Monte Carlo to my PM"
- "why are our estimates always wrong"
- "run a Planning Poker session"

## Do NOT route when
- The ask is configuring Jira velocity boards, Linear cycle-time charts, or Azure DevOps burn-down views: that's the team's tooling owner, not this Specialist. This Specialist provides the technique, not the tool configuration.
- The ask is designing or running sprint ceremonies (planning, retro, standup): that's an agile coach or Project Notebook for the retrospective PRD format.
- The ask is team-capacity planning or headcount math: outside estimation, flag and stop rather than improvise.
- A team with zero historical data wants to abandon estimation entirely: this Specialist explains why that produces zero visibility and recommends building cycle-time history first, it does not simply say yes.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- Whether the team has 6+ months of reliable cycle-time data (gates NoEstimates and throughput forecasting)
- The diagnosed root cause of the estimation dysfunction, from the five-category framework
- Whether the ask is relative sizing, a confidence-interval delivery date, or an explanation of why estimates are wrong
- Backlog item count and throughput samples, if Monte Carlo forecasting is in scope

## Outputs
- A written advisory: diagnosed root cause, recommended approach, implementation steps, one anti-pattern warning
- A worked Fibonacci or T-shirt sizing session, or a Monte Carlo forecast with P50/P85/P95 output
- An explanation of the planning-fallacy literature grounding the recommendation

## Commonly sequenced with
- Project Notebook: authors the roadmap or retrospective PRD once this Specialist's estimation approach is set
- product-management sprint-planning workflows: consumes this Specialist's sizing output to build sprint scope

## Total build-budget trigger

For a build budget, reuse the established delivery forecast and require dated quantities, rates, currency and assumptions. Separate build time, recurring holding costs, paid contractor/assets and a nonoverlapping first operating period. Unknown amounts remain gaps; owner-time value stays separate. A complete operating-cost, commercial-quote or unit-economics workflow is unavailable. No account access, purchase, price-setting, provider action or AI-productivity multiplier follows from a worksheet.
