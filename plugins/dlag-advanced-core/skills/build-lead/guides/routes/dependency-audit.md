# Dependency Audit routing

Use **Dependency Review** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
Dependency Review inspects the open-source supply-chain surface and prepares recommendations for scanner selection/configuration (Dependabot, Renovate, Snyk, socket.dev, OWASP Dependency-Check), vulnerability triage with CVSS scoring and exploitability context, supplied or proposed SBOM generation (Syft, CycloneDX, SPDX plus Sigstore attestation), lockfile discipline (`npm ci` enforcement, `minimumReleaseAge`, `lockFileMaintenance`), and provenance verification (npm `--provenance`, PyPI PEP 740). It treats `npm audit` as a CVE compliance tool, not a supply-chain security tool, and pushes teams toward behavioral scanning for the account-hijack class of attack.


## Trigger phrases
- "audit our dependencies"
- "set up Renovate"
- "Renovate vs Dependabot"
- "generate an SBOM"
- "npm audit is noisy"
- "lockfile hygiene"
- "npm provenance"
- "Snyk CI gate"
- "Explain package.json and lockfiles to me"
- "Which dependencies are direct or indirect?"

## Do NOT route when
- The CVE requires application-code changes: Security Review analyzes risk, while an authorized implementation owner supplies fixes.
- The task is Docker image scanning pipeline architecture: that's GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller.
- The task is license compatibility legal advice: route to legal counsel, outside Specialist scope entirely.
- The task is application-code vulnerability remediation more broadly: Security Review reports those vulnerabilities; a qualified implementer owns fixes. This review focuses on the supply chain.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- The project's language/package manager (npm, pnpm, pip, uv, poetry, cargo)
- The CI platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab, other)
- Existing scanner configs (`.snyk`, `renovate.json`, `.github/dependabot.yml`)
- Whether the scenario is new setup, existing-scanner audit, CVE triage, SBOM build, or provenance check

For a beginner reading, use the current owner's local Playbook. Identify the actual ecosystem first. Preserve declared versus recorded versus observed evidence; do not install or change dependencies as an explanation step.

## Outputs
- A proposed scanner/CI configuration with rationale; no settings write or installation
- A CVE triage table with CVSS context, exploitability, and recommended resolution
- An SBOM generation proposal or a report bound to actual supplied artifact hashes; generation remains unrun without receipts

## Commonly sequenced with
- Security Review: takes over once a CVE needs an application-code fix rather than a dependency bump
- GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller: owns the Docker scanning pipeline and broader CI/CD architecture this Specialist's scanning step slots into
- GitHub Workflow: overlaps on repo hygiene checks but this Specialist owns the dependency-specific depth

For the requested outcome, use the current owner's local Playbook and preserve manifest/lock/install/final-artifact scope, exact hashes, schema/coverage checks and expected attestation identity separately. For the requested outcome, use the current owner's local Playbook: exact old/new versions, consumed API/vendor contracts, bounded canary and data-compatible rollback. No scanner installation, publish or real upgrade is implicit in preparation.
