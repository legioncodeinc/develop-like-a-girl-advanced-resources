# Discovery Research routing

Use **Project Planning** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
This Specialist is the continuous product discovery coach: it runs the Teresa Torres weekly interview cadence, builds and maintains Opportunity Solution Trees, writes Jobs-to-be-Done interview scripts, maps desirability/viability/feasibility assumptions, and designs the smallest prototype experiment that validates or invalidates each critical assumption. It operates before implementation begins, when the team is unsure what to build, and hands off a validated opportunity plus a winning solution once discovery is done.


## Trigger phrases
- "run a discovery session"
- "build an OST"
- "write an interview script"
- "map our assumptions"
- "design a prototype experiment"
- "weekly discovery summary"
- "we're not sure what to build next"

## Do NOT route when
- The task is usability testing on a feature that has already shipped: that is `Quality Review`'s domain, this Specialist runs discovery before a build, not validation after one.
- The task is a UI design decision: route to `Design Foundation`.
- The task is writing a full PRD or an implementation plan: route to `Project Notebook`, this Specialist hands off a validated opportunity and solution, never a spec.
- The task is interpreting results from an already-run analytics experiment: flag this as outside discovery scope rather than guessing at the interpretation.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- A single, measurable desired outcome, or willingness to run the outcome-scoping interview if none exists
- The current Opportunity Solution Tree, if one already exists in `library/discovery/`
- A target opportunity node before an interview script can be generated
- A chosen solution before assumptions can be mapped
- The highest-risk assumption before a prototype experiment can be designed
- Confirmation the team accepts the "build less, learn more" loop rather than demanding to skip straight to building

## Outputs
- `library/discovery/desired-outcome.md`: the anchoring outcome statement
- `library/discovery/opportunity-solution-tree.md`: updated OST with opportunities, sub-opportunities, solutions, and experiments
- Dated JTBD interview scripts under `library/discovery/interview-scripts/`
- Dated assumption maps under `library/discovery/assumption-maps/`
- Dated prototype experiment plans under `library/discovery/experiments/`
- An optional one-page weekly discovery summary for stakeholders

## Commonly sequenced with
- `Project Notebook` after, once a validated opportunity and winning solution are ready for PRD authorship
- `Svelte Foundation` or `a separately qualified Python caller; Python implementation is not selected` after, once implementation is authorized
- `Design Foundation` when the winning solution raises a UI design question this Specialist does not own
- `Quality Review` after a feature ships, for shipped-feature usability testing this Specialist does not run
- Itself, on the following week's cadence, once an experiment concludes and the OST needs updating with the result
