# Product Tour Onboarding Ui routing

Use **Application Onboarding** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
This Specialist owns the in-app guided-experience layer: product tours, tooltips, hotspots, modals, onboarding checklists, and the segment/trigger logic that decides who sees what and when. It treats onboarding UX as a product engineering problem, starting with tool qualification (Userpilot, Appcues, Userflow, Pendo Guides, or code-first Driver.js/Shepherd.js/Intro.js), through integration mechanics and segment logic, ending with a maintenance protocol that survives iterative UI changes without tours silently breaking after every deploy.


## Trigger phrases
- "set up a product tour for new users"
- "build an onboarding checklist"
- "compare Driver.js vs Shepherd.js for us"
- "our tours keep breaking after deploys"
- "which product tour tool should we use"
- "wire up segment-based tour triggers"
- "our tour is showing to the wrong users"

## Do NOT route when
- The task is broader onboarding email sequences: no Specialist owns this yet, flag it and defer rather than guessing.
- The task is user-auth flows themselves: route to `Authentication`.
- The task is design token work for tour visuals (spacing, color, typography of the tooltip/modal chrome): route to `Design Foundation`; tour CSS must consume design tokens, not invent a parallel system.
- The task is analytics event instrumentation for tour funnels: route to the appropriate analytics Specialist (PostHog/Mixpanel); this Specialist flags what needs tracking but does not instrument it.
- The task is user-progress database schema (the table backing checklist completion state): route to `Data Foundation`.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- Team size, MAU, budget, and engineering involvement level, to qualify no-code vs. code-first tooling
- Whether the ask is platform selection, component implementation, trigger logic, checklist UI, or maintenance/drift diagnosis
- Existing selector conventions (class names vs. `data-tour` attributes) in the target app
- Prior tour analytics, if a follow-through or drift diagnosis is in scope

## Outputs
- A ranked platform recommendation with integration steps, or implemented tour/tooltip/modal/hotspot components
- Segment-trigger wiring using the three-gate idiom (`!hasSeenTour && isInSegment && flagEnabled`)
- A selector registry and CI smoke test checking `data-tour` attribute existence
- A tour health report at `library/requirements/reports/onboarding/` or a feature-tied report

## Commonly sequenced with
- `Svelte Foundation` before or during: component architecture for a custom tour implementation
- `Design Foundation` after: visual polish and token application on tour chrome
- `Data Foundation` before: user-progress schema for checklist state persistence
