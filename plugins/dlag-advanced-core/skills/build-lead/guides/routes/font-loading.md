# Font Loading routing

Use **Font and Image Delivery** for the bounded decisions below. Check [scope and tool limits](../scope-and-tools.md) first. A route is a proposed handoff until actual availability, authorization and a dispatch receipt are established. Implementation, provider operations and tests remain unperformed unless the capable caller supplies their evidence.

The selected stack is Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte, Neon Postgres/Drizzle, WorkOS customer identity, Doppler secrets, Vercel application functions, Cloudflare R2 and transactional Resend. Payload CMS has its own Next.js host and built-in editor identity. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout only when requested. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected. Framework/provider-specific recipes that require another stack are unavailable. Reuse the decision criteria, inputs, negative routing and output requirements only inside that selected scope; consult the current owner's Playbook before any concrete API or configuration recipe.



## Domain
This Specialist owns the mechanics of the browser's font loading pipeline: `font-display` descriptor selection (swap/optional/fallback/block) with CLS risk analysis, `<link rel="preload">` strategy with correct `crossorigin`, variable-font subsetting via pyftsubset/glyphhanger/subfont, framework-independent SvelteKit/Vite font loading, and eliminating CLS from font swaps via `size-adjust` and `ascent-override` metric-matched fallbacks. It sits between the upstream aesthetic decisions of Design Foundation and the CI infrastructure of GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller, owning everything in between.


## Trigger phrases
- "audit font loading"
- "fix FOIT"
- "CLS from font swap"
- "configure font loading in SvelteKit/Vite"
- "preload fonts"
- "subset variable font"
- "font-display strategy"
- "font performance checklist"

## Do NOT route when
- The ask is typeface aesthetic selection or fluid type scale construction: that's Design Foundation, this Specialist starts once a typeface is chosen.
- The ask is build-pipeline CI automation for font subsetting: that's GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller, this Specialist provides the exact CLI command, not the pipeline wiring.
- The ask is broader Core Web Vitals measurement beyond CLS: that's Website Builder for page metadata, or Browser Checks for measured performance; marketing strategy remains unavailable, this Specialist is scoped to the CLS consequence of font loading specifically.
- The font is a paid or licensed typeface and the user hasn't confirmed a web license permitting subsetting: stop and ask before recommending self-hosting.

## Inputs the Specialist needs
- The presenting symptom: FOIT, FOUT with CLS, FOFT, slow load, or a proactive audit request
- Existing `@font-face` rules, preload links and font-delivery code, or their absence
- Actual SvelteKit SSR/Vite asset paths and server/browser rendering behavior; other framework font APIs are unavailable
- Whether the project self-hosts fonts (needs subsetting) or loads from Google Fonts

## Outputs
- Corrected `@font-face` rules with explicit `font-display` and metric-matched fallback overrides
- `<link rel="preload">` markup with `crossorigin="anonymous"` correctly set
- A selected-stack font configuration proposal, or a version-qualified subset command for a capable authorized caller

## Commonly sequenced with
- Design Foundation: supplies the typeface and scale decisions this Specialist implements the loading mechanics for
- GitHub Workflow for review of existing CI evidence; broader CI implementation needs a designated capable caller: automates the subsetting CLI command this Specialist specifies into a CI step
- Website Builder for page metadata, or Browser Checks for measured performance; marketing strategy remains unavailable: measures the broader Core Web Vitals picture this Specialist's CLS fix feeds into
