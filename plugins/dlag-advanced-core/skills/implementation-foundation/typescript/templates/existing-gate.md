# Existing gate record

| Type checking | | | | |
| Svelte and CMS React/accessibility/type-aware lint | | | | |

CI must not quietly fix source. A local pre-commit tool is a convenience and does not substitute for the complete program check. Do not install hooks, lint-staged, a new runner, formatter, package manager, or dependency to fill an empty cell. Missing required evidence remains unproven. Review Security, Quality and repository health in order before any separately authorized commit/push/release.
