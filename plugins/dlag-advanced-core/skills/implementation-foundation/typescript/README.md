# TypeScript Foundation

This private implementation resource covers Svelte application types, SvelteKit server boundaries, Vercel runtime distinctions, Neon/Drizzle data contracts, bounded async work, testing and artifact evidence. The implementation role retains its local read/write scope. Optional scripts are for a separately authorized capable caller.

The examples implement their stated small contract. They do not supply an authentication adapter, a database schema, a deployment configuration, a new job service, or provider approval. Copying a type contract cannot establish any of those behaviors. Report exact remaining prerequisites before adapting a recipe into application code.
