  Unstructured scratch space for humans. Agents do not touch this folder.
  Put anything here: rough notes, links, half-formed ideas, meeting notes.
  Nothing in notes/ is authoritative or maintained.
  For persistent reference, move content to knowledge/private/ when it matures.

# Notes

Human-only scratch space. Agents never read or write here.

Put rough notes, links, and half-formed ideas here. Nothing here is authoritative.

When a note matures into reference material, move it to `knowledge/private/<domain>/`.
