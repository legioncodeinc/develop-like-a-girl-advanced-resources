# Knowledge: Private

This area explains the system and business to the team. It also holds the evidence and decisions that support audience documents.

## Shared folders

| Folder | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `architecture/` | Architecture narratives and `ADR-<n>-<kebab-slug>.md` decision records |
| [`contracts/`](contracts/README.md) | `CTR-<###>-<slug>.md` shared API, event, data, permission, or state agreements |
| `standards/` | `documentation-framework.md` and repository writing or engineering rules |

## Add domains as needed

Use domains such as `auth/`, `data/`, `security/`, `operations/`, `strategy/`, `personas/`, or `reporting/` when the sources support them. Add a README that explains the domain. Do not seed unrelated domains or assume a technology stack.

project foundation planning, when available, builds the private current-state and foundation material before implementation. audience-document preparation uses supported sources to write documents for specific readers. Keep their draft decisions, source gaps, evidence, and review records private until the owner approves a public statement.

## Store the right material

Keep PRDs in `requirements/` and IRDs in `issues/`. Keep curated explanatory Markdown here when it is internal. Put approved external Markdown in `knowledge/public/`. Keep brand assets and generated Word/PDF files at an agreed location outside `library/`.
