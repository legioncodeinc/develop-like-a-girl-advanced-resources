# 02, Inventory All Changes

Read [review boundaries](../boundaries.md) first. Git/Python snippets describe optional evidence collection by an authorized caller with those tools; this read-only role consumes supplied evidence and never executes them.

Capture every file added, modified, or deleted by the implementation. No silent passes on changes outside the diff.

---

## Primary invocation

Use the three-dot `git diff` against the base branch. This matches what the PR page shows.

```bash
# Name + status per file (A=added, M=modified, D=deleted, R=renamed)
git diff main...HEAD --name-status

# Full patch for close reading
git diff main...HEAD

# Summary stats (lines added/removed per file)
git diff main...HEAD --stat

# Scope to a subdirectory if the diff is huge
git diff main...HEAD -- src/search/
```

Replace `main` with the actual base branch (`master`, `develop`, `release/X`) as applicable. Verify by asking `git` which branches exist:

```bash
git branch -r
git remote show origin 2>/dev/null | grep 'HEAD branch'
```

## Mid-session fallback

If the work is not yet committed, the three-dot diff misses uncommitted changes. Use the combined invocation:

```bash
git status --short                  # what's uncommitted
git diff                            # unstaged changes
git diff --staged                   # staged but uncommitted
git diff main...HEAD                # everything on the branch
```

Merge these into one inventory list. Flag in the report that the audit was done against a dirty working tree, this is a note for the invoker, not a blocker.

## Bind the inventory to the reviewed content

Record resolved full base/head IDs and the reviewed dirty contents, including untracked inputs. Branch labels and HEAD alone cannot identify them. Reuse the receiving repository's manifest tooling and declare scope, excluded inputs and freeze policy. See [verification artifacts](08-verification-artifacts.md). Keep generated output identity separate from source identity.

## Building the Files Changed list

From the `--name-status` output, build a deterministic list. Sort alphabetically within each status group. Example:

```
A  app/services/search.server.ts
A  app/services/search.types.ts
M  app/services/rank.server.ts
M  [actual-drizzle-migrations]/[actual-migration].sql
D  src/legacy/old-ranker.ts
R  src/optional processing/Embedder.ts -> src/optional processing/BatchEmbedder.ts
```

This feeds the "Files Changed" section of the report. For each file, record a one-line summary of what changed (you'll write these as you work through steps 3-4, not now).

## What to read vs. what to skim

You do not have to read every line of every file. Use this triage:

| File type | Treatment |
|---|---|
| New source files (`A`) | Read in full. |
| Modified source files (`M`) | Read the diff hunks, then read surrounding context for any hunk touching public exports or function signatures. |
| Deleted files (`D`) | Grep the rest of the repo for remaining references. A deletion with dangling callers is a Critical. |
| Renamed files (`R`) | Confirm all import paths updated. |
| Generated files (lock files, build output) | Skim for surprises; usually no finding. |
| Snapshot tests (`.snap`) | Only read if a corresponding source file changed. |
| Config (`.env.example`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`) | Read in full, small files with outsized impact. |
| Docs (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) | Confirm they reflect the change if the plan said to update them. |

## Cross-check against the plan's scope

Once you have the inventory, compare it against the plan's declared scope:

- **Out-of-scope files in the diff?** Flag under the Alignment axis, scope creep. (Warning by default, Critical if the out-of-scope change is risky like the required server authorization gate or `[actual-drizzle-migrations]/[actual-migration].sql`.)
- **In-scope files missing from the diff?** Flag under Completeness, a plan requirement with no touched file is almost certainly not implemented.

## Repo-specific signals

Watch for files that carry outsized risk regardless of plan scope:

- The required server authorization gate, every server operation passes through it.
- `[actual-drizzle-migrations]/[actual-migration].sql` / dataset migration code, data-model changes require extra scrutiny.
- `tsconfig.json`, `esbuild` config, `turbo.json`, build pipeline changes.
- `.env.example`, a new required env var the deployer must set.
- `package.json`, dependency adds. Cross-check with the plan ("did the plan authorize adding this dep?").

Any of the above that were not mentioned in the plan should appear in the report, usually as a Warning with "out-of-scope change to high-risk file."
