# Explain a repository overview and one journey

Use this method when the supplied question needs a small map of the repository before one concrete flow. Technical Explainer stays Read/Grep/Glob/Skill and returns the explanation in chat. A source command, repository instruction or example does not grant execution or writing tools.

Read [the full method](../references/full-method.md), [repository-flow procedure](explain-repository-flow.md), [fidelity and terminology](../references/terminology-and-fidelity.md) and [the explanation packet](../references/templates/explanation-packet.md). For a deep architecture corpus or an expressly requested saved narrative, use the available [Project Notebook narrative method](../../project-notebook/knowledge/README.md). A named handoff does not prove dispatch or give this role Write/Edit.

## Establish the reader and safe source boundary

Confirm the supplied repository/root and revision or working-copy identity, the reader's experience, one question, privacy restrictions and expected output. Ask only unresolved facts that affect the explanation. When no repository is accessible, request that source before repository-specific claims. Do not convert one journey into a whole-codebase audit.

Read the actual README, relevant manifests, route or CLI entry points, configuration names and data definitions needed for the selected flow. Follow calls/imports only within the authorized scope. Exclude credentials, private customer records and human notes. Record unavailable helpers, external dependencies and dynamic dispatch explicitly. A folder or filename is evidence of an artifact, not proof of installed tooling, effective permissions or a running service.

## Build the factual map before the analogy

Use [the claim ledger](../references/templates/source-to-claim-ledger.md). For each meaningful statement record its actual source path, symbol or supplied section, inspected revision/dirty identity, claim type and missing evidence. Distinguish author claims, inspected implementation, accepted requirements, inference and actual runtime observations.

Trace the chosen journey from caller/input through verified identity, resource selection, permission, work, data access, response and failure. Include an allowed and denied case only when the source supports them. Preserve async/pending states, transaction boundaries, recovery and external effects; a function name or a UI check does not prove the server's gate. When code and an accepted contract disagree, state both with their sources instead of silently choosing a version.

Explain the larger parts only far enough to locate that journey. Name the actual framework/runtime and component responsibilities from supplied evidence. Do not infer a database, queue, identity provider, native application or deployment from a diagram. Source presence, build declarations, test declarations, executed checks and live configuration stay separate.

## Return a complete bounded explanation

Use the existing packet to organize:

1. The product's source-supported purpose and the one reader question.
2. A short map of the real parts and their responsibilities.
3. The selected factual journey, including permission/denial and failure branches.
4. Optional familiar analogy, its exact technical mapping and where it breaks.
5. A glossary defining new terms before they become prerequisites.
6. The real entry file and an illustrative change location relevant to the reader's question.
7. Existing setup/check instructions that actually appear in inspected sources, stated as unrun instructions when execution was not observed.
8. Accessible source locations, unread scope, conflicts and facts that could change the explanation.

The illustrative change is a teaching locator, not an implementation proposal or completed edit. Do not invent command names or recommend running repository code merely because a manifest lists a script. A capable authorized implementation caller must inspect any proposed command's effects and actual environment. This explanation executes none of them.

## Review fidelity and reader context

Compare every behavior sentence with its ledger row. Preserve actor, action, object, permission, conditions, order, result, status and uncertainty. Define jargon, use concrete sentences and keep the factual account next to the analogy. Remove an analogy that adds a false permission or hides a denial branch.

For a requested prose review, the available [Project Notebook writing method](../../project-notebook/writing/README.md) supplies the full reader-lens and code-example review. Optional independent review remains unperformed until actual authorized dispatch and its result exist. A readability estimate does not establish technical correctness or comprehension.

## Optional teach-back for a requested teaching interaction

When the user requested teaching, prepare these three prompts with answer references to the explanation. Ask one focused question at a time under [the understanding method](verify-understanding.md); do not demand a yes/no claim of understanding.

| Prompt | Answer reference to include |
| --- | --- |
| Which real file begins the selected journey, and what input starts it? | The actual entrypoint and first ledger row |
| Who checks identity and permission, and what happens when the condition fails? | The actual verifier/permission/denial source, or the explicit missing implementation |
| What source proves the result, and what remains unexecuted or unknown? | Inspected output branch versus actual check receipts and coverage gaps |

These are prepared prompts, not observed answers. If the reader responds, assess meaning, explain a missed relationship another way and ask one focused follow-up within the operating limits. Without an answer, understanding remains Pending. A model answer or static checker is not learner evidence.

## Save or export only through an actual capable owner

Return the explanation in chat. When the user already requested a saved local Markdown report, hand the exact requested destination, safe sources and complete draft to the current authorized writer or Project Notebook's actual available method. The writer checks collisions and saves/reads back only the scoped document; do not claim this read-only role saved it. An unavailable writer leaves an explicit unsaved draft.

Word/PDF packets, live connector retrieval, additional assistant configuration and publication are not selected here. Their absence does not block the completed chat explanation. Preserve private source locations within the authorized audience. Report actual output, fidelity checks, not requested/pending/observed teach-back and every unrun step without claiming a separate Specialist, application execution, security clearance or release.
