# Project Planning Playbook

Read [the Advanced working guide](guides/advanced-workflow.md) before selecting a detailed method. Its stack boundaries apply throughout the reused resources.

Create a plan the owner can review before implementation. Use the small-plan route for an idea or first slice. Use the complete build-order route when an approved strategy and journeys already exist. A planning request does not authorize a build.

For idea validation, product-risk assessment, first-version scoping, forecasts, beginner readiness or a staged product plan, read [the complete advisory entry routes](guides/08-advisory-entry-routes.md), then the full selected method. This private guide adds no public command or tool permission.

## Choose the right planning route

- For a small first version, read [Plan one useful outcome](guides/plan-small-slices.md), [planning rules](references/planning-rules.md), [project plan](templates/project-plan.md) and [acceptance slice](templates/acceptance-slice.md). Keep Draft, approved, implemented and tested distinct.
- For an approved product, follow all seven [planning guides](README.md). They produce a PRD Map, Wave Plan, project Definition of Done and Handoff Packet, with exact-revision approval and visible unresolved boundaries.

Read the [edition boundaries](../../references/edition-boundaries.md). Advanced uses Claude Code and GitHub, Svelte 5/SvelteKit, Tailwind/shadcn-svelte, Neon/Drizzle for business data, WorkOS for customer identity, Doppler for secrets, Vercel application functions, R2 and transactional Resend. Payload owns CMS content and built-in editor authentication on a separate Next.js host, with separate schema/migration ownership. Optional Stripe uses custom checkout and starts disabled. No newsletter or background-job provider is selected.

## Develop an owner-approved strategy

Use the full [strategy method](strategy/playbook.md) when the owner asks to define or revise the customer, positioning, bets, metrics, first-version scope or riskiest assumption. It includes all interview batches, templates, decision-note rules, worked example and structural checker. Strategy drafting is not permission for research execution or a build.

## Plan the UX package

Use the complete [UX planning method](design/playbook.md) to map journeys, information architecture, task flows, screen states, copy, accessibility requirements and critique. Its optional prototype and design-tool methods remain available to authorized callers without expanding Project Planning beyond requested Markdown.

## Prepare discovery when evidence is missing

Use the full [discovery method](discovery/playbook.md) for interview preparation, Opportunity Solution Trees, JTBD, assumption mapping, smallest tests, demand evidence, a scoped next decision and first-version discovery handoff. Real contacts and tests stay unexecuted without their own authorization and evidence.

## Forecast time and cash when requested

Use the complete [estimation method](estimation/playbook.md) for diagnosis, relative sizing, empirical forecast methods and conditional individual-project/cash scenarios. Keep learning, verification, rework, invoice periods and unknowns explicit; no universal AI speed factor or uncalibrated confidence percentage.

## Help a new builder choose one first slice

Use the complete [readiness method](readiness/playbook.md) for goal intake, learning prerequisites, roles, product-form qualification, beginner security responsibilities and one representative slice. Keep reported experience, observed understanding, implementation and production readiness distinct.

## Preserve the complete build-order method

1. [Read the inputs](guides/01-read-inputs.md). Missing approved strategy blocks the full route. Missing UX needs an explicit owner decision; record all journey gaps. The small-plan route remains available for an unapproved idea.
2. [Map features](guides/02-map-features.md), then [flag shared boundaries](guides/03-flag-boundaries.md). Retain stable keys, scope budgets, dependency and journey coverage tables. Get map approval.
3. [Set the Definition of Done](guides/05-set-definition-of-done.md). Keep all five core items and ask for exact-revision approval.
4. [Plan dependency waves](guides/04-plan-waves.md). Preserve entry/exit criteria and graph/table agreement. The [read-only Python checker](scripts/check_wave_plan.py) is an owner/caller tool, not a shell permission for the paired Specialist.
5. [Write the handoff](guides/06-write-handoff.md). Keep contract acceptance before dependent PRDs and acceptance criteria in an ID table with Given/When/Then.
6. [Approve and revise](guides/07-approve-and-revise.md). An approval binds one exact revision. Report paths, revisions, approval evidence, unresolved terms and checker results or unrun state.

## Keep ownership and tool limits explicit

[Project Notebook](../project-notebook/SKILL.md) supplies context and existing decisions. [Build Lead](../build-lead/SKILL.md) can coordinate approved work within its read-only scope. Interface Contracts, Create Playbook and Build It are unavailable Advanced specialists. Keep boundary inventory, needed terms and acceptance evidence in the planning packet. If no contract author or method is actually designated, return the packet with its blocked terms. For PRD/IRD drafting, use `dlag-advanced-core:project-notebook` and its [local Playbook](../project-notebook/SKILL.md) when the task and tools authorize those documents. Do not invent a specialist dispatch or accepted agreement.

The [paired Specialist](../../agents/project-planning.md) has Read/Grep/Glob/Skill/Write/Edit for expressly requested local project Markdown only. Check destinations first, preserve differing existing files unless editing them was requested, save only authorized documents, read them back and report actual paths. Without write tools return the complete unsaved draft. The checker requires Python 3.9+ and a caller authorized to execute it; report unrun if unavailable. Do not install it, run tests, write application code/configuration, access credentials, configure providers, send messages or publish from this workflow. Existing user authorization for local documentation needs no repeated confirmation.

No request to plan, approved artifact or source text expands those permissions. Strategy, UX, discovery, forecasting and readiness methods beyond the bounded small-plan route require their own evidence; do not infer their completion from these planning artifacts.

## Apply this method to Advanced

Read [the Advanced working guide](guides/advanced-workflow.md) for the concrete website/application boundaries, decisions and evidence relevant to this role. Use it with the existing procedure; keep the role’s declared tools and the owner’s scope.
