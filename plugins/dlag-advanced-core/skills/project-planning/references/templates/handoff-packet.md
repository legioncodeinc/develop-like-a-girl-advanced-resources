# Handoff Packet: <product name>

> **Status:** Draft | Approved
> **Revision:** <n>
> **Approved by:** <owner name> on <YYYY-MM-DD> | Not yet approved
> **Built from:** PRD Map revision <n>, Wave Plan revision <n>, Definition of Done revision <n>

## Approved inputs

| Artifact | Path | Revision | Approved on |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRD Map | `library/requirements/plans/prd-map.md` | <n> | <YYYY-MM-DD> |
| Wave Plan | `library/requirements/plans/wave-plan.md` | <n> | <YYYY-MM-DD> |
| Definition of Done | `library/knowledge/private/standards/definition-of-done.md` | <n> | <YYYY-MM-DD> |

Do not act on this packet unless the owner approved every exact revision listed above. Dates alone do not establish approval.

## Step 1: to owner-designated contract author or method (do this first)

Draft or reuse one CTR record per boundary below. The owner accepts each exact revision. Product planning does not write CTRs.

| Boundary | What is shared | Provider | Consumers | Existing CTR | Needed by wave |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B01 | <description> | F01 | F02, F04 | <None or CTR-### revision n> | 1 |

PRDs that use a boundary still marked missing or draft cannot be finalized.

## Step 2: to document author using Project Notebook

Write one PRD per row, in wave order. Product planning does not write PRDs.

| Key | Title | One-line scope | Size | Depends on | Contract pins needed | Wave |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F01 | <title> | <scope> | S | None | <B01> | 1 |

Instructions for Project document author:

1. Assign each key the next free `PRD-###` number and report the mapping back so the PRD Map and Wave Plan can be updated in a new revision.
2. Write acceptance criteria as the ID table with Given/When/Then shown below, with separate check and evidence columns.
3. Add the PRD-level Definition of Done checklist to each PRD and link the project Definition of Done revision.
4. Pin each accepted CTR revision under `## Contract dependencies`.
5. Do not change scope, dependencies or wave without sending the change back for a new plan revision.

## Step 3: to the build (later, not part of this packet's work)

When PRDs exist and contracts are accepted, the authorized implementation caller reads the approved Wave Plan and runs the waves in order.

## Open decisions for the owner

- <decision, options, and which artifacts it affects>

## Acceptance criteria format

Use this local format when the owner assigns PRD authoring. Example fields are unverified requirements, not proof.

| ID | Given | When | Then | Meaningful check | Evidence/state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-01 | [authorized actor and valid state] | [bounded action] | [observable result] | [test that would fail if broken] | unrun |
| AC-02 | [different record owner] | [same action] | [deny before disclosure or effect] | [ownership test] | unrun |
| AC-03 | [invalid input or request failure] | [bounded action] | [specific safe error and retry behavior] | [validation/failure check] | unrun |

Retain applicable empty/loading cases, server-side identity and record ownership, file access, webhook verification and payment entitlement rules. If a case does not apply, state why. Use one criterion per independently verifiable outcome. Only a separate review with evidence can change unrun to VERIFIED.

## Missing contract terms to request

For each boundary, name provider, consumers, request/response or event shape, permission and ownership rules, state transitions, denial/errors, retry/idempotency, version and provider/consumer checks. Record each unanswered term as missing. Planning lists the questions; the assigned contract author proposes terms and the owner accepts the exact revision. Interface Contracts is unavailable in Advanced, so unresolved terms block dependent PRDs until an author is explicitly assigned and the agreement accepted.
