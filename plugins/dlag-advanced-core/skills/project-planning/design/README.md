# Product UX planning guide map

Use the [UX planning method](playbook.md) to write an inspectable local design package. Project Planning authors Markdown; an authorized Design Foundation implementation caller handles actual HTML/Svelte work and relevant execution.

## Templates

Use the complete [journey](references/templates/journey-map.md), [IA/screen map](references/templates/ia-screen-map.md), [task flow](references/templates/task-flow.md), [screen spec](references/templates/screen-spec.md), [direction options](references/templates/direction-options.md), [content/voice](references/templates/content-voice.md), [accessibility baseline](references/templates/accessibility-baseline.md), [critique rubric](references/templates/critique-rubric.md), [optional external brief](references/templates/claude-design-brief.md), [optional import review](references/templates/claude-design-import-checklist.md), [HTML state/theme starter](references/templates/prototype-starter.html), [package index](references/templates/design-package-readme.md) and [planning handoff](references/templates/planning-handoff.md).

The HTML starter is a code template with placeholders and illustrative navigation targets; it is not a complete navigable application. Its full CSS, state/theme controls, semantic markup and local state simulation are retained for adaptation. Actual preview, responsive checks, contrast measurement and browser interactions remain unrun until an authorized caller performs them.

[Layout and IDs](references/package-layout.md) describe artifact homes and approval states. [Research explanation](references/research/distilled-product-design.md) retains historical source findings, conflicts and limits. Optional Claude Design capabilities are historical research notes; check the owner's actual available interface before promising a format or operation. Nothing depends on owning that service or on an old counterpart repository.

[The checker](scripts/check-design-package.py) uses Python 3.9+ standard library only: `package` checks structural markers; `inventory` lists file/archive sizes and hashes without extraction. Inventory's optional JSON output is a caller write, outside Project Planning's Markdown-only scope. A clean inventory does not make HTML scripts safe to execute; a clean package does not establish WCAG conformance or browser behavior.
