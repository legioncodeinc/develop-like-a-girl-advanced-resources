# Project Notebook resource map

Use the existing [review-and-draft method](guides/review-and-draft.md) for context, source journeys, decisions and focused drift review. The detailed procedures below supply document organization and requirements detail when the requested outcome needs it. Read [capability boundaries](references/library-boundaries.md) before its operational instructions and [schema conventions](references/library-schema-and-workflows.md) for destinations. A narrow context request does not trigger a Project Notebook scaffold.

For a beginner explanation of one task's documents, owners, evidence and recovery, read [the Advanced work journey](guides/10-starter-work-journey.md), [learning worksheet](templates/starter-work-journey.md) and [constructed export-status example](examples/starter-work-journey.md). This is reading and documentation guidance, not a general build executor or contract-authoring workflow.

## Select the requested outcome

| Request | Complete procedure | Worked resource |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initialize documentation | [Guide 00](guides/00-initialize.md) | [Framework](templates/documentation-framework.md) and folder README seeds |
| Explain a system or write a guide | [Guide 01](guides/01-knowledge-base.md) | [Architecture](examples/kb-architecture-example.md), [API](examples/kb-api-reference-example.md), [how-to](examples/kb-how-to-guide-example.md) |
| Track an existing GitHub issue | [Guide 02](guides/02-issue.md) | [IRD template](templates/ird-template.md), [current example](examples/ird-042-example.md), [expanded example](examples/issue-042-example.md) |
| Plan a feature | [Guide 03](guides/03-feature-prd.md) | [PRD template](templates/prd-template.md), [index example](examples/prd-007-example.md), [backend feature example](examples/feature-007-example.md) |
| Document existing implementation | [Guide 05](guides/05-backwards-prd.md) | PRD template; status follows actual evidence |
| Review structure and source drift | [Guide 06](guides/06-maintenance.md) | Existing [review template](templates/notebook-review.md) |
| Coexist with entity-derived pages | [Guide 07](guides/07-wiki-sync.md) | Identify source paths and ownership; automated extraction unavailable |
| Reuse an observed workflow | [Guide 08](guides/08-reuse-workflow-templates.md) | [Evidence fields](references/template-reuse-fields.md), existing PRD/IRD formats |

For selected-package component ownership, routing and resource-reference drift, use [the component drift method](guides/09-component-reference-drift.md). Keep [method selection and authority](references/role-method-boundaries.md) visible when consolidating requirements, decisions, narratives and prose review.

The missing Guide 04 number is intentional. Independent implementation findings belong to the separately packaged Quality Review method, after Security Review. This Playbook records source context and links, never manufactures a QA report or accepted contract terms. No installed contract-authoring method is advertised.

## Record and revisit a decision

Use [the ADR methods](adr/README.md) for full Nygard/MADR records, five-clause summaries, reciprocal supersession, log review and onboarding. Plain Markdown is the default; optional tooling is a separately requested task.

## Explain a system or source journey

Use [the narrative methods](knowledge/README.md) for complete source-grounded architecture, auth, schema/catalog, security and standards explanations, or a bounded beginner/meeting/diagram request. Existing short context drafts remain available.

## Write for the reader

Use [the writing methods](writing/README.md) for mode classification, full code-example review, house style, reader calibration, ghostwriting and actionable prose findings.

## Complete template inventory

Folder seeds retain YAML `ai_description` and `human_description`. The initialization guide provides the destination copy map. Read and fill them locally only within an expressly requested documentation task. The three compatibility names do not reintroduce old paths.

- [Project Notebook](templates/library-README.md), [Knowledge](templates/knowledge-README.md), [Public Knowledge](templates/knowledge-public-README.md), [Private Knowledge](templates/knowledge-private-README.md), [Contracts](templates/contracts-README.md).
- [Requirements](templates/requirements-README.md), [Backlog](templates/requirements-backlog-README.md), [In Work](templates/requirements-in-work-README.md), [Completed](templates/requirements-completed-README.md), [Reports](templates/requirements-reports-README.md).
- [Issues](templates/issues-README.md), [Issue Backlog](templates/issues-backlog-README.md), [Issue In Work](templates/issues-in-work-README.md), [Issue Completed](templates/issues-completed-README.md).
- [Framework](templates/documentation-framework.md), [PRD](templates/prd-template.md), [IRD](templates/ird-template.md).
- Compatibility seeds: [Knowledge](templates/knowledge-base-README.md), [Requirements](templates/features-README.md), [Reports](templates/qa-README.md).
- [Human notes notice](templates/notes-README.md) is explanatory reference for the human. An agent never creates, reads, edits or seeds `library/notes/`.

Existing [project context](templates/project-notebook.md), [decision record](templates/decision-record.md) and [review](templates/notebook-review.md) remain available.

## Verification and history

Check requested destinations, collisions, numbering across every lifecycle, source citations, exact accepted revision pins, template placeholders and instantiated relative links. Read saved Markdown back. Do not promote lifecycle from a sketch, a source extraction or a completed template. Public-folder placement does not authorize disclosure or publication.

Supporting procedures and templates are packaged locally. No executable script is required for these document-authoring methods. Shared contract validation uses the manual checks in the guide; an additional automation tool must be selected separately.

## Advanced adaptation

The complete reviewed Starter methods are reused here. Read [the Advanced working guide](guides/advanced-workflow.md) alongside them. Historical research retains its original edition/provider context and dates; it is supporting evidence, not the Advanced stack selection. Runtime guidance follows SvelteKit/Vercel, Neon/Drizzle, WorkOS, Doppler and the separate Payload Next.js host with built-in editor auth. Helpers and configuration templates remain inert source for an appropriately authorized caller. Existing filenames containing `starter` are retained compatibility paths, not a different installed dependency.
