# Domain taxonomy: choose only source-supported topics

For each requested domain record what belongs, what belongs elsewhere and which actual sources support it. Create no empty folders or fixed quota. Literal library/ paths follow the existing Project Notebook schema. The approved stack is SvelteKit SSR on Vercel functions, Neon/Drizzle data and WorkOS identity, Doppler secrets, R2 and transactional Resend.

## `architecture/`

Narrative docs explain actual system shape alongside the separate ADRs that record decisions.

**What belongs:** a system overview with a Mermaid diagram and component/decision tables; request lifecycle with caller, identity gate, data/file operations and response; server/client placement; current route-to-service boundaries. Cite actual routes, server-only modules and accepted choices.

**What NOT to include:** copying an ADR as a how-it-works explanation, inventing services to make a diagram symmetrical, or treating a desired architecture as implemented. Explain actual mechanisms and link to the existing accepted record for why.

---

## `ai/`

Use this domain only when an actual, separately accepted application feature uses AI. Inspect its actual prompts, retrieval, model/embedding boundaries, data flow and failure behavior before documenting them. No AI provider, vector store, daemon, session capture, memory or model call is selected by Advanced.

**What belongs:** a bounded explanation of the feature actually present, its authorized data sources, optional versus required dependencies and explicit unsupported/failure paths.

**What NOT to include:** transplanting an unrelated memory pipeline, automatic schema healing, synthetic vector tables or an assumed provider. Missing implementation is a gap, not permission to add one.

---

## `auth/`

Explain WorkOS identity and actual application permission enforcement separately.

**What belongs:** the supported sign-in/recovery/callback sequence; exact server verification path and identity source; cookie/session lifetime and revocation behavior; account-versus-record ownership; actual optional membership policy. Show denied/expired/cross-owner cases and client/server secret boundaries.

**What NOT to include:** a new token issuer, device-flow CLI or credential file that the app does not implement. Sign-in alone never proves access to another owner's record or R2 object.

---

## `data/`

Provide one consolidated reference for the actual in-scope Neon PostgreSQL schema rather than disconnected feature fragments.

**What belongs:** every table/column/type/nullability/default, primary/foreign/unique/check constraints, indexes, triggers/functions, RLS policies and relevant grants; their real migration sources; writers/readers and record ownership; file metadata versus R2 bytes; actual migration/backfill/version behavior. A key/catalog reference records its purpose, owner, lifecycle, expiry and actual usage where such objects exist.

**What NOT to include:** a fixed seven-table schema, guessed defaults, omitted columns replaced with ellipses, unselected automatic healing or R2 access supposedly inherited from RLS. Feature-specific planned schema changes stay in their PRD until their status is explicit.

---

## `integrations/`

Explain actual supported external boundaries used by the application, not a roster of unrelated coding assistants.

**What belongs:** request/webhook contracts, verified sender and raw-body signature handling, environment/account mapping, input validation, idempotency, retry ownership, durable state and provider acceptance versus final delivery. Examples may concern selected WorkOS, Neon, Payload, R2, Resend or optional custom Stripe only when actually used.

**What NOT to include:** automatic assistant shims, unselected vendors or a background queue merely because a source example mentions one. Claude Code is the only supported assistant; no adapter development is required for a site/app explanation.

---

## `plugins/`

Ordinary Advanced applications do not require an MCP/plugin domain. Use it only for an explicitly accepted extension that the real target implements.

**What belongs when present:** actual transport/lifecycle, tool inputs/outputs, permissions and data effects from inspected source. Keep the extension boundary distinct from application routes.

**What NOT to include:** invented MCP servers, plugin distribution, extra assistants or source-registry dependencies. If the requested product has none, omit the domain.

---

## `frontend/`

Explain Svelte 5 and SvelteKit SSR surfaces from actual load functions/form actions, components, forms and state ownership.

**What belongs:** visible user journey, data provenance, server/client split, pending/error/empty states, accessible controls, Tailwind and shadcn-svelte primitives actually used. Record SSR/hydration evidence separately from source review.

**What NOT to include:** a dashboard/graph visualizer that does not exist, server secrets in loader output, or client UI visibility as server authorization.

---

## `infrastructure/`

Document the actual repository build, test, CI and Vercel hosting boundaries.

**What belongs:** existing package scripts/versions/lockfile and SvelteKit/Vite build flow; actual SvelteKit adapter/server entry; Doppler secret placement by Vercel environment; actual R2/Resend connectivity; observed release/rollback steps. Distinguish a proposed configuration from a deployed one.

**What NOT to include:** automatic npm publishing, daemon provisioning, deployment, new dependencies or an unselected hosting provider. No background runner is selected.

---

## `multi-tenant/`

Use only when the accepted product actually has organizations/workspaces or a tenant model. Otherwise document user-owned data without inventing extra account levels.

**What belongs:** actual identity-to-membership mapping, trusted tenant derivation, owner/role checks, scoped queries, cross-tenant denials and any revocation behavior. Explain which checks are application-enforced and which database policies implement them.

**What NOT to include:** tenant authority derived from a browser ID, an unimplemented role hierarchy or claimed isolation based only on function names.

---

## `security/`

Explain actual trust boundaries, data classification and secret handling; this narrative is not an independent vulnerability clearance.

**What belongs:** a Mermaid boundary diagram with enforcement source for each crossing; browser input to SvelteKit validation; WorkOS identity versus record permission; database versus R2 file authorization; webhook signature and entitlement boundaries; public/private data categories, output/log redaction and credential lifecycle. Name unknown enforcement explicitly.

**What NOT to include:** tokens, signed URLs, customer records, hypothetical guarantees or the inference that a box labeled trusted enforces access. Independent Security Review remains separate.

---

## `standards/`

Record conventions proven by the actual project rather than importing another repository's preferences.

**What belongs:** TypeScript boundaries/strictness, request validation, HTTP/error conventions, server-only modules, actual formatting/lint/package manager, testing and Git/PR conventions. Cite real configuration, symbols and examples.

**What NOT to include:** an npm-versus-pnpm decree without target evidence, a special ORM/column-definition pattern not used by the app, or an install/upgrade task hidden inside documentation.

---

## `collaboration/` and `operations/` (as needed)

Use collaboration/ only for actual application collaboration or authorized worker ownership, not assumed shared memory. Operations/ explains real diagnostics, incident handling, capacity, retention, retry, recovery and escalation procedures. Cite actual tooling and runbooks, environment scope and owner gates; never turn a document into authorization to prune data, change providers or restart a live system.

---

## `overview.md` (top-level, not in a subfolder)

A single `overview.md` at the root of `library/knowledge/private/`. The human-curated entry point - the README for the entire knowledge base.

**Required sections:**
1. What the target repo is (1-2 paragraphs in plain English). Do not infer product features from a documentation template.
2. Top-level architecture summary from actual components, boundaries and data objects; name only mechanisms observed in the target
3. Key modules / components
4. Where to start reading (role-based reading guide)
5. Coverage facts with inspected scope, missing decisions/domains and actual verification date; counts alone do not prove fidelity

## `content/` (when editorial content is selected)

Explain the separate Payload Next.js host, content collections, published/draft access, built-in editor authentication and media ownership. Keep editor authority distinct from WorkOS customer membership. Document Payload’s schema/migration owner separately from Neon/Drizzle business records; neither tool receives implied authority over the other’s tables.
